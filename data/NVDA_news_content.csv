36444192,Benzinga Insights,2024-01-01T16:00:31Z,2024-01-01T16:00:32Z,Industry Comparison: Evaluating NVIDIA Against Competitors In Semiconductors &amp; Semiconductor Equipment Industry, ,benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36444192/industry-comparison-evaluating-nvidia-against-competitors-in-semiconductors-amp-semiconductor-equipm,['NVDA'],2024-01-01 16:00:32+00:00,NVDA,Industry Comparison: Evaluating NVIDIA Against Competitors In Semiconductors &amp; Semiconductor Equipment Industry - NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) - Benzinga,"Amidst the fast-paced and highly competitive business environment of today, conducting comprehensive company analysis is essential for investors and industry enthusiasts. In this article, we will delve into an extensive industry comparison, evaluating NVIDIA NVDA in comparison to its major competitors within the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry. By analyzing critical financial metrics, market position, and growth potential, our objective is to provide valuable insights for investors and offer a deeper understanding of company's performance in the industry.
 Nvidia is a leading developer of graphics processing units. Traditionally, GPUs were used to enhance the experience on computing platforms, most notably in gaming applications on PCs. GPU use cases have since emerged as important semiconductors used in artificial intelligence. Nvidia not only offers AI GPUs, but also a software platform, Cuda, used for AI model development and training. Nvidia is also expanding its data center networking solutions, helping to tie GPUs together to handle complex workloads.
 Upon analyzing NVIDIA, the following trends can be observed: 
 The stock's Price to Earnings ratio of 65.33 is lower than the industry average by 0.57x, suggesting potential value in the eyes of market participants.
 The elevated Price to Book ratio of 36.77 relative to the industry average by 5.32x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value.
 The stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 27.48, surpassing the industry average by 3.16x, may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance.
 The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 30.42%, which is 24.69% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential.
 The Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $10.96 Billion is 0.47x below the industry average, suggesting potential lower profitability or financial challenges.
 The company has lower gross profit of $13.4 Billion, which indicates 0.73x below the industry average. This potentially indicates lower revenue after accounting for production costs.
 The company's revenue growth of 205.51% is notably higher compared to the industry average of -3.19%, showcasing exceptional sales performance and strong demand for its products or services.
 
 The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio assesses the extent to which a company relies on borrowed funds compared to its equity.
 Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.
 In terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, NVIDIA can be assessed by comparing it to its top 4 peers, resulting in the following observations:
 NVIDIA demonstrates a stronger financial position compared to its top 4 peers in the sector.
 With a lower debt-to-equity ratio of 0.33, the company relies less on debt financing and maintains a healthier balance between debt and equity, which can be viewed positively by investors.
 NVIDIA's low PE ratio suggests that it is undervalued compared to its peers in the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry. The high PB ratio indicates that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's assets. Similarly, the high PS ratio suggests that investors are willing to pay a higher price for each unit of the company's sales. On the other hand, NVIDIA's high ROE indicates that it is generating strong returns on shareholder equity. The low EBITDA and gross profit ratios suggest that the company may have lower profitability compared to its peers. However, the high revenue growth indicates that NVIDIA is experiencing strong sales growth.

36443875,Aditi Ganguly,2024-01-01T15:00:10Z,2024-01-01T15:00:11Z,Looking Beyond The 'Magnificent 7' — Analysts Just Upgraded These Three Large-Cap Stocks, ,benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/general/24/01/36443875/looking-beyond-the-magnificent-7-analysts-just-upgraded-these-three-large-cap-stocks,"['BUD', 'META', 'NVDA', 'QSR', 'SPOT']",2024-01-01 15:00:11+00:00,NVDA,"Looking Beyond The 'Magnificent 7' — Analysts Just Upgraded These Three Large-Cap Stocks - Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) - Benzinga","The Magnificent Seven stocks have dominated the stock market this year, driving the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index's over 43% year-to-date gains.
 The large-cap tech stocks mainly banked on the booming artificial intelligence (AI) sector and the growing popularity of the metaverse. AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. NVDA has been the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock this year, gaining over 234% year to date. Meta Platforms Inc. META is close behind with over 193% gains over the same period. 
 With immense upside over the past year, many experts speculate the tech behemoths have peaked. With recession fears looming for 2024, diversifying outside of big tech can hedge investors' portfolios in the event of a market downturn. 
 As of Dec. 4, the recession probability model from the New York Federal Reserve indicates a 51.8% likelihood of a U.S. recession occurring within the next 12 months.
 Irrespective of the concerning market backdrop, analysts are bullish on these large-cap stocks in the near term.
 Up over 140% year-to-date, Spotify Technology SPOT is one of the biggest music streaming companies in the world. 
 Spotify enjoys strong financials, as its total monthly active users increased 26% year over year to 574 million in the fiscal third quarter ended Sept. 30. The company's revenue increased 11% year over year to €3.36 billion ($3.7 billion). Operating income came in at €32 million, compared to a loss of €228 million reported in the same quarter last year. 
 The company slashed its workforce by 17% earlier this month, which is expected to reduce its operating expenses by roughly 2% in fiscal 2024. 
 ""Over the last two years, we've put significant emphasis on building Spotify into a truly great and sustainable business — one designed to achieve our goal of being the world's leading audio company and one that will consistently drive profitability and growth into the future,"" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said. ""While we've made worthy strides, as I've shared many times, we still have work to do. Economic growth has slowed dramatically, and capital has become more expensive. Spotify is not an exception to these realities.""
 Analysts expect Spotify's revenue to rise by 17.3% year over year to $17.21 billion in fiscal 2024. In addition, Wall Street predicts Spotify's earnings per share (EPS) to be $2.05 next year. 
 Pivotal Research recently upgraded its rating on Spotify stock from Hold to Buy, with a price target of $265, indicating a potential upside of over 39%. Rosenblatt Securities also upgraded its outlook on Spotify to Buy, with a price target of $300, which reflects a price target of over 58%.  
 Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA BUD was caught up in a major controversy earlier this year when transgender publicist Dylan Mulvaney promoted Bud Light beer through her Instagram account, angering conservative consumers. Anheuser-Busch, the largest beer manufacturer in the U.S., reported a sharp decline in sales in the third quarter as the controversy intensified amid a nationwide boycott from conservatives. 
 The company has taken steps to improve its consumer rankings by rebranding its packages. 
 ""We recognize that over the last two months, the discussion surrounding our company and Bud Light has moved away from beer, and this has impacted our consumers, our business partners and our employees,"" the company said in a statement. ""We are a beer company, and beer is for everyone.""
 Anheuser-Busch shares have recovered, rising by over 14% over the past three months. JPMorgan expects this momentum to continue, as the financial institution has an Overweight rating on Anheuser-Busch stock with a price target of $79, reflecting a 22.5% potential upside. 
 Restaurant Brands International Inc. QSR is one of the largest restaurant companies in the world, with 2022 sales of about $39 billion at nearly 30,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. 
 The company manages popular beverage and fast food chains such as Tim Hortons, Burger King, Firehouse Subs and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. As the holiday sales kick in, Restaurant Brands' revenue is expected to rise 7.1% year over year in the quarter that ends in December. 
 RBC Capital has an Outperform on Restaurant Brands stock with a price target of $87, indicating a potential upside of nearly 12.4% from the current price. BMO also has an Outperform rating on Restaurant Brands with a price target of $85, indicating a potential upside of over 9% from the current price.

 Shares of Apple Inc. AAPL experienced the sharpest sell-off — over 4%. The Cupertino, California-based company shed $116 billion in market cap in a single session. 
 This plunge, the most severe since early August 2023, was triggered by a sell call from a Barclays analyst, Tim Long, who downgraded the iPhone maker from Equalweight to Underweight, while also lowering the price target from $161 to $160. 
 The other six tech titans — Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOG GOOGL, Amazon Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc. META, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Tesla, Inc. TSLA — also saw their market caps decrease. 
 The Magnificent Seven had an impressive rally in 2023: Their equal-weighted index delivered a 110% performance, setting new all-time highs. 
 However, traders seem to have adopted a more conservative stance at the onset of 2024, especially after the robust rally in the last two months of the 2023 year. 
 This downturn wasn’t confined to the Magnificent Seven alone. The broader tech sector also felt the impact, with the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 index, falling by 2.2%.
 The market, which was previously buoyed by optimism around anticipated Fed rate cuts — with a 90% probability of a cut as early as March and five more by the end of December — is now pausing to reflect on ongoing economic and geopolitical risks.
 Recent weeks have seen heightened tensions in global trade, especially in the Red Sea region. Iran-backed Houthi rebel attacks on commercial ships have forced major maritime shipping lines to reroute, avoiding the Gulf of Aden and the Suez Canal, leading to increased shipping times and costs.
 Further affecting the tech landscape, European chipmaker giant ASML Holdings N.V. complied with a White House request to halt shipments of some machines to China, weeks before export bans on high-end chip making equipment were to take effect. 
 This move has sent ripples through the semiconductor industry, already off to a rocky start in 2024, with the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX falling 4%.

 A new report shows that several members of Congress beat the overall market by a significant margin in 2023.
 What Happened: The overall stock market had a rebound in 2023 with major stock indexes like the S&P 500 ending the year positive and trading near record highs.
 Despite the strong returns of stock indexes, several members of Congress had stock trades in 2023 that led to outperforming the S&P 500.
 A new report from Unusual Whales shows that 115 members of Congress disclosed transactions in 2023, which was down from past years. Of the trading members, around one third beat the S&P 500 in performance last year.
 The average gains were 31.18% for Democrats and 17.99% for Republicans, versus a gain of 24.8% for the S&P 500, which is tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY.
 The report indicated a decrease in both the average number of transactions and the time taken to disclose trades by members of Congress in 2023, compared to the previous three years. This trend emerges as calls to ban congressional trading have intensified. Notably, the value of these transactions increased in 2023, surpassing $1 billion based on the maximum size of the disclosed trades.
 The report emphasizes several conflicts of interest, drawing attention to the specific committees that members of Congress serve on and how these positions may intersect with their stock trading activities.
 Unusual Whales also highlights a higher number of options traded in 2023, a number that surpassed the levels reported in both 2022 and 2021.
 Top 10 Stock Traders in Congress: Similar to the 2022 and 2021 years, Unusual Whales has compiled who the best stock traders were among members of Congress based on trades exercised during the year.
 Here's a look at the top 10 for 2023:
 Green stands out as the sole member of Congress who ranked in the top 10 for stock trading performance in both 2022 and 2023. After securing the 10th position in the previous year’s top 10 list, Green climbed to the second rank in 2023.
 Pelosi and Rouzer ranked among the top 10 in 2021, ranking sixth and seventh respectively in that year's report.

 Best Trades of 2023: Along with naming the top members of Congress by overall performance in 2023, the report also highlights the top realized gains on trades in 2023.
 Despite taking up four of the top 10 places on the list for individual trades, Gottheimer was not one of the 10 best overall traders. Gottheimer also appeared more times on the best individual trades, with two more Nvidia trades profiting over 40% each.
 Gottheimer also was listed with the best individual trade in 2022's report.
 The Representative recently disclosed having $5 million to $25 million worth of in-the-money call options of Microsoft Corporation MSFT. Gottheimer was previously employed by Microsoft, with the trades potentially being related to grants he received while employed with the company.
 Key Highlights: Pelosi is among the most scrutinized members of Congress regarding trading activities. The former Speaker of the House has faced questions about the timing of various trades executed by her husband, venture capitalist Paul Pelosi.
 Benzinga recently shared that the Pelosis bought $1 million to $5 million in Nvidia options. The purchase came after it was disclosed that the couple sold their Nvidia stock for a loss in 2022 after the timing related to the CHIPS Act and Pelosi's trip to Taiwan were called into question. The early sale by the Pelosis ended up coming with poor timing and missing out on millions of dollars in profit if the couple had continued to hold the stock that soared over 200% in 2023.
 The report also highlights Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) who is one of the most active traders in Congress. Tuberville sits on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry and actively trades futures of wheat, corn, soy and cattle.
 Tuberville's purchase of Humacyte HUMA, a penny stock that may have profited from the Ukraine war with Russia, is also flagged in the report.
 Unusual Whales helped launch two Congress Trading themed ETFs in 2023 through a collaboration with Subversive. The Unusual Whales Subversive Democratic Trading ETF NANC and Unusual Whales Subversive Republican Trading ETF KRUZ provide investors with opportunities to invest in the same stocks as members of Congress.

 What To Know: The Magnificent 7 mega-cap tech stocks led markets higher last year with remarkable gains. Nvidia Corp NVDA was the best performer of the group with gains of more than 235%. Apple Inc AAPL was the laggard among the mega caps, but it still jumped nearly 50% in 2023. 
 Moving into 2024, most analysts expect the Magnificent 7 to take a back seat to the rest of the market and Munster is no different. 
 ""I agree with that consensus. I think the substance of the performance is really going to come with that sub-$20 billion market cap,"" Munster said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""
 There is a ""seismic shift"" starting to brew in AI and some of the smaller market cap companies are going to benefit this year, which will ultimately lead the Russell 2000 to outperform the S&P 500 in 2024, he said.

 Why It Matters: Munster believes tech stocks are heading into a three- to five-year bull run, but he's not betting on the usual suspects to lead the charge in 2024.
 He told CNBC he recommends a dumbbell approach where investors maintain some exposure to the mega caps, but also buy some of the underappreciated AI names like Unity Software Inc U and Etsy Inc ETSY. 
 Unity is known for game development, but the company is starting to work on building spatial environments using AI technology, which could help lift the stock, Munster said. 
 Etsy has been somewhat ""forgotten,"" but the e-commerce company is slated to start implementing AI to help build more creative products, which should bode well for the stock, he added. 
 On the other side of the barbell, Munster told CNBC that Alphabet Inc GOOG and Apple are his top picks in the Magnificent 7 for 2024.

 The tech sector played a notable role in dragging down the broader stock market performance. Interestingly, blue-chip and small-cap stocks managed to dodge substantial losses, showing marginal gains. Among the prominent “Magnificent Seven” stocks, six were in the red, with Tesla Inc. TSLA being the sole exception, maintaining a flat performance for the day.
 Apple Inc. AAPL took a notable hit, tumbling by 3%, marking its most challenging session since early September, following a downgrade from Barclays. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and other semiconductor stocks, tracked by the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, also experienced a significant drop of 2.8% for the day. 
 This decline was triggered by a White House request to ASML Holdings N.V., Europe’s chip giant, to halt some product exports to China, just weeks before the planned restriction
 The U.S. dollar displayed a robust surge, while Treasury yields moved higher by about seven basis points across the yield curve.
 In the commodities market, oil had a volatile day, initially rising by as much as 3% before giving up those gains. Gold, on the other hand, remained steady, while silver saw a slight 0.4% dip. Furthermore, Bitcoin BTC/USD crossed the 45,000 mark, driven by growing optimism regarding the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF by Jan. 10.

Here's a look at the biggest gainers and laggards in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
 What Happened: The Dow Jones Industrial Average was created in 1896 by Charles Dow and is one of the oldest and most followed equity indexes for overall stock market health. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit an all-time high of more than $37,000 in December 2023.
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average consists of 30 stocks on a price-weighted basis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA, which tracks the index, is one of the most invested and followed ETFs.
 In 2023, 19 of the Dow Jones component stocks were up, with 11 stocks declining for the full year.
 The top five gainers for the full year were:
 The top five losers for the full year were:
 Four of the top five best-performing Dow components ranked in the top five at the mid-point of the year, with Salesforce, Apple, Microsoft and Intel ranking first, second, third and fourth, respectively, at the end of June.
 Boeing jumped to the top five, passing American Express Company AXP, which ended the year tied for sixth with a 26.8% gain on the year.
 Microsoft and Apple were two of the top gainers for the Dow Jones in 2023 and among the most talked about stocks for the year and gainers in other indexes. Microsoft made a splash in the artificial intelligence sector with a $10 billion investment in ChatGPT parent OpenAI in January. Apple released the newest version of the iPhone in the fall.
 Intel was one of many chip stocks that saw a surge in its share price, but the 90% gain trailed the performance of NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, which was up over 220% in 2023. 
 For the losers, Walgreens led the way with a 30% drop in its share price. Oil stock Chevron ranked second with a near 17% drop, which came after oil stocks outperformed in 2022.

 Why It's Important: After being up around 4% through the first six months of 2023, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained a total of over 14% for the full year.
 The gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average comes after 2022, which saw an 8.5% decline. Through the first six months of 2023, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF was up 3.9%, with a strong second half leading to a double-digit gain.
 The gains of the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged several other major stock market indexes including the S&P 500, which was up 24.2% and the Nasdaq 100, which was up 53.8% for the full year.
 The performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other indexes was likely overshadowed by the performance of the Magnificent 7 stocks in 2023. The seven technology stocks of Alphabet Inc GOOGGOOGL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Apple, Meta Platforms I  META, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla Inc TSLA were among the top gainers in 2023 and made up a sizable portion of gains for indexes they were included in.
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average and other stock market indexes could be closely monitoring the 2024 presidential election, which could see the new year bring gains as in past years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.3% in 2020, 13.4% in 2016 and 7.3% in 2012, the three most recent presidential election years. The average return of the index is +5.4% over the past 16 presidential election years.

This downturn comes in the wake of the White House’s directive to a prominent European chipmaker, signaling escalating U.S.-China trade tensions.
 What Happened: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA witnessed a decline of 4%, while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD experienced a sharper drop of over 5%. Overall, the largest U.S.-traded 25 semiconductor companies have seen nearly $100 billion erased in market value in just the first trading hours of Tuesday.
 As Bloomberg reported, Dutch chipmaker supplier ASML Holdings N.V ASML complied with U.S. President Joe Biden‘s request to halt certain shipments to China weeks ahead of a new export ban’s enforcement.
 ASML, Europe's tech giant, confirmed the Dutch government partially revoked licenses for shipping specific lithography systems to China, impacting a few customers. Despite these developments, ASML believes the recent blockade won’t significantly affect its 2023 financial outlook. Shares of ASML Holding N.V.  dropped by 4.3%, marking their weakest daily performance since late July.
 Why It Matters: In 2023, semiconductor stocks, as tracked by the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, closed with a 66% gain, the best since 2009’s 74% annual increase. Yet the onset of 2024 presents challenges as the market begins to weigh the risks of a potential new tech trade war and its negative influence on the sector’s growth.

 Musk and the other nine richest people in the world all saw their wealth grow dramatically in 2023 thanks to a strong stock market and soaring prices of technology stocks.
 Here's a look back.
 What Happened: The S&P 500 ended 2023 on a streak of consecutive weeks with positive gains, helping boost the stock prices of many large caps further to end the full year. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, which tracks the S&P 500 was up 24% in 2023, which came after a decline of 19% in 2022. 
 The soaring stock prices helped boost the wealth of the ultra-wealthy, with the top 10 richest people in the world gaining a combined $465.4 billion in wealth in 2023.
 Here are the top 10 richest people in the world to close out 2023 and a look at how much their wealth increased, as reported by Bloomberg. 
 Together the top 10 billionaires ended 2023 worth $1.47 trillion, which would rank as the sixth-largest company, with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA currently valued at $1.22 trillion. The 10 billionaires have an average wealth of $147.4 billion.
 The billionaires saw their wealth grow by an average of $46.5 billion in 2023 for a total gain of $465.4 billion. Together, the 10 richest people gained more than the market capitalization of Walmart Inc WMT. The retail giant is valued at $424.4 billion.
 Surpassing Walmart’s valuation comes as Jeff Bezos’s Amazon.com remains a dominant force in the ecommerce sector, exerting significant competitive pressure on brick-and-mortar retailers, including Walmart and similar companies.
 The $465.4 billion amassed by the top 10 billionaires also exceeded the market capitalizations of major corporations like Novo Nordisk, Broadcom Inc, Samsung, Mastercard and ExxonMobil.

 Why It's Important: The 10 richest people weren't the only ones who gained in 2023 with the top 14 richest people all adding to their wealth. Eleventh ranked Carlos Slim ended the year with a wealth of $105 billion, gaining $31.0 billion.
 Outside of the top 10, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was one of the top gainers of the year with the soaring valuation of the chip stock, as its market capitalization topping $1 trillion for the first time.
 Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was also a top gainer in 2023 with a wealth of $34.4 billion, gaining $21.8 billion and ending the year ranking 42nd.
 Gautam Adani ended 2023 as the 15th richest person in the world, losing $36.2 billion as the biggest decliner among the world's richest people. Adani and his companies were the subject of short reports in 2023.
 Among the world’s 30 wealthiest individuals, only six experienced a decrease in their wealth in 2023. Similarly, within the top 50 richest people globally, 11 witnessed a decline in their wealth last year.
 Other decliners in the top 50 were Charles Koch, Jacqueline Badger Mars and John Mars who lost $4.63 billion, $8.16 billion and $8.16 billion respectively.

 This is a continuation of the call just before the close of 2023. Consider continuing to take partial profits on tactical positions by scaling out. Consider continuing to hold very long term strategic positions.  New members, consider reading the “Strategic Vs. Tactical,” “Strategy,” and “Tactics” sections of a prior Afternoon Capsule.
 Elections in Taiwan are ahead. China is threatening to invade if Taiwanese people vote for the pro-independence candidate. If China decides to invade Taiwan and President Biden decides to defend Taiwan, there is a prospect of World War III.  In The Arora Report analysis, the probability of an invasion is low.  Nonetheless, you should not underestimate this risk.
 The Red Sea is important because 12% of the world’s commerce moves through the Red Sea. The U.S. sank three Houthi boats over the weekend. The U.S. action came after Houthis attempted to sink a large commercial vessel that the U.S. had vowed to protect. Houthis are based in Yemen and are backed by Iran.
 In The Arora Report analysis, the probability is high that Iran will back off as Iran understands that it is no match for the U.S. naval power.  Having said that, prudent investors should keep an eye on the situation.  Oil is running up.

 There is a rumor that a Bitcoin BTC/USD ETF will be approved as soon as tomorrow.  The rumor has driven bitcoin above the key level of $45,000. The SEC has until January 10 to make a decision on bitcoin ETFs.
 Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is 🔒. This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades.
 It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.
 Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.
 You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.
 It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.  High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.
 Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.
 Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, META, and NVDA.
 Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.
 We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:
 The SPY SPY is currently trading around our level of 474.04. For the bulls, an initial rise to 475.02 is sought, with hopes of maintaining strong price action above this level to eventually reach 476.10 and, if successful during regular trading hours, extend upwards to 477.25. The ambitious target for the day is set at 478.16.
 Conversely, if 474.04 does not hold as a support, bears might push the price down to test the 473.40 level. If sellers dominate, we anticipate further tests at 472.68, with heavy selling potentially leading to a strong support at 471.40. The lowest bear target for the day is 470.63, indicative of a significant sell-side session.
 The Q's QQQ are currently positioned around 406.58. Bulls are looking for upward movement above 407.64, aiming to establish 408.80 as strong support. If buying continues robustly, 409.44 may come into play, with an ideal scenario leading to a test of 410.34. The highest bull target today is 410.90.
 If holding above 406.58 becomes problematic during regular trading hours, we anticipate bears to aggressively push the price down to 405.66. In case of continued weakness, bears might target 404.76 and further look to challenge 403.59. The day's lowest bear target is 403.08, anticipated if the level fails to hold as strong support.
 Apple's AAPL auction is revolving around 189.44. Bulls are encouraged by holding this level as support, with aspirations to advance the auction higher to 190.52 and maintain the momentum to potentially reach 191.57. The day's ambitious bull target for Apple is 192.27.
 Should 189.44 not sustain as support during regular trading, a lower test at 188.56 is expected. With continued selling, the bearish trajectory might lead to 188.20 and further pressure could bring 187.50 into the equation. The day's low bear target for Apple is 186.99.
 Microsoft MSFT is currently hovering around 373.48. Bulls seek to solidify this level and drive the auction upward to 375.11, ideally holding it as support during the day and continuing the push to 375.93. The day's high target for Microsoft is 376.70.
 If 373.48 fails as a support during regular trading, bears are likely to test 372.03 and potentially push further down to 370.10. On continued bearish momentum, the price could descend further to 368.79. The lowest bear target for the day is set at 366.98.
 Tesla TSLA is currently auctioning around 246.16. Bulls are eyeing an upward push to 248.37, followed by a rally to the key level of 250.25. In a strong bullish market, Tesla might test even higher at 252.38. The highest bull target for the day is 254.28.
 If 246.16 cannot be maintained as a robust level of support in today's session, bears may look to drive the price down to 243.98. If the selling continues, 242.49 may be tested, leading to a potential significant drop to the day's low bear target for Tesla at 239.92.
 Alphabet GOOGL is currently situated around 138.39. Bulls are hopeful to maintain this as a supportive base and push the auction higher to 139.46, ultimately aiming for the high bull target of 140.05.
 Should 138.39 fail to hold as a supportive level during regular trading hours, bears may lead the price to 137.79. If this level is compromised, the price might be further driven down initially to 136.94. In a scenario of heavy selling, the lowest bear target for the day is set at 136.29.
 Meta META is auctioning near 350.18. Bulls aim for the auction to stay robust above this level, moving higher to 351.97 and potentially to 353.60. The day's high bull target for Meta is 354.93.
 If 350.18 cannot hold as support during regular trading hours, bears might initiate a move down to 347.67. Continued selling pressure could lead to further declines to 345.04. In a pronounced bearish scenario, the lowest target for the day is 342.89.
 NVIDIA NVDA is currently trading around 489.04. Bulls are looking to elevate the auction to 492.33 and secure it as a strong support level, with hopes of pushing the price further up to 495.79. The bullish momentum might extend up to the high target for the day at 499.62.
 If 489.04 does not hold as a strong support in today's session, bears might target 485.93 for a test lower. A breakdown of this level could lead to a drop to 483.43. In a weaker auction scenario, bears may test down to 481.27, with the lowest bear target for the day at 478.67.
 Final Word:  Happy New Year and welcome to the first trading day of 2024! Today's data releases are light, featuring the Final Manufacturing PMI for December and the Construction Spending data for November. The Treasury will auction 3 and 6 Month Bills in the afternoon session. Be mindful of the trading volume as the participation might be low due to the holiday season. Wishing everyone good luck and a strong start to 2024!

 The Dutch government's decision impacts the NXT:2050i and NXT:2100i systems, which are essential for advanced microprocessor production. 
 This move complements U.S. export restrictions and aligns with a September directive mandating Dutch semiconductor firms to seek official approval before exporting specific chip-making tools.
 ASML, a specialist in photolithography crucial for chip manufacturing, has announced that the recent revocation of its export license and U.S. export restrictions will not likely affect its financial projections for 2023.
  
 
 Last week, Nvidia introduced the GeForce RTX 4090 D, a new version of its high-end gaming chip tailored to meet U.S. export restrictions aimed at China. 
 Nvidia crafted the GeForce RTX 4090 D in close consultation with the U.S. government to fully comply with export controls. 
 It plans to unveil three new AI chips for the Chinese market faced delays, leading to the postponement of one chip's launch to the following year, with the other two yet to be listed on Nvidia's China website. Nvidia holds a commanding 90% share of China's $7 billion AI chip market.
 Meanwhile, AMD is gearing up to launch the Radeon RX 7600 XT graphics card on January 22, targeting the lower end of the market. 
 This release comes as Nvidia looks to unveil more budget-friendly options, including an economical RTX 3050 and Super variants of the RTX 4070, 4070 Ti, and 4080. 
 Notably, the RTX 4070 Super will likely debut around the same time as AMD's new offering.
 Nvidia stock has gained 239% in the last one year, while AMD has gained 128%.
 Price Actions: NVDA shares traded lower by 1.05 % at $490.05 premarket on the last check Tuesday. AMD shares traded lower by 2.45% at $143.80.

This Machine Learning Expert Thinks So - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) - Benzinga","Artificial intelligence (AI) took the world by storm in 2023, and it could very well dominate the discourse in 2024, too. But does modern AI have to thank the iconic first-person shooting game Quake?
 What Happened: AI's vast dependence on graphics processing units (GPU) has been a critical aspect in the development of this industry – both on the AI side of things, as well as for the topline of companies like Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD, among others.
 The original Quake game was released back in 1996. It popularized 3D gaming with its 360-degree views and set the tone for modern games for years to come. Modern-day gaming features like ""clans"" and truly popularized the concept of multiplayer gaming, making it an extremely popular first-person shooter.

 All these features required id Software – the developer behind Quake and Doom, among others – to use GPU features more extensively. It was the first game to support hardware-accelerated graphics rendering, significantly improving visuals and the overall gaming experience.
 Quake brings back many memories for those born in the 1970s, 80s, or even 90s. Gartner's former machine learning chief, Andriy Burkov, has credited Quake for making modern AI possible.
 ""Modern AI has become possible thanks to this game: the first really 3D first-person shooter that benefited from a GPU,"" he said.

 Since then, GPUs have come a long way. From running games like Quake to now training massive neural networks on massive datasets for large-language models, the evolution of GPUs has been staggering.
 Why It Matters: GPUs are now powering advanced, cutting-edge technologies like AI. From advancements in the healthcare sector to revolutionizing industries, AI holds a lot of potential. Even Microsoft Corp. MSFT co-founder Bill Gates thinks AI will supercharge innovation that humanity stands to benefit from immensely.
 Perhaps Quake's popularity and advanced 3D mechanics back in the 1990s helped boost the adoption of GPUs and, therefore, innovation by GPU makers like Nvidia and others.

 What Happened: The intervention took place weeks prior to the enforcement of more stringent Dutch regulations on high-end chipmaking equipment exports in January, as per a Bloomberg report. The U.S. President Joe Biden‘s administration sought ASML’s cooperation in stopping the shipments of certain machines to Chinese clients as a strategy to impede Beijing’s progression in its own advanced semiconductor industry.
 ASML, the sole manufacturer of this specific technology, held licenses to export three top-of-the-line deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines to China until the new regulations were implemented. These machines are crucial for the production of semiconductors, which are essential components in a wide variety of devices, from smartphones to advanced military equipment.
 Upon the U.S. request, a number of shipments were called off, but the exact number of the affected units, which are worth tens of millions of dollars each, remains undisclosed.

 Peter Wennink, ASML’s CEO, has expressed concern that these measures might incite China to develop a competing technology. He pointed out that these new restrictions could affect up to 15% of ASML’s sales in China.
 Why It Matters: The move comes in the backdrop of a significant year for Huawei Technologies Co., which saw its revenue skyrocket by 9% in 2023 in spite of US sanctions. The Chinese tech giant’s revenue was boosted by a thriving smartphone sector and robust 5G equipment sales.
 Meanwhile, NVIDIA Corp NVDA, the world’s leading chipmaker, was forced to market a stripped-down version of its premier gaming chip in China due to US export controls.
 The US administration’s latest action against ASML seems to be a part of its strategy to limit China’s growing technological prowess. However, this move could also inadvertently spur China to develop its own competing technologies.

 This comes in the backdrop of analysts predicting a new bull market for tech stocks in 2024, driven by increased spending on innovations in cloud and AI technology. Ives had previously stated in November 2023 that the tech bull market has begun and is set to intensify in 2024.
 Why It Matters: Tech stocks have been on a roll, with the NASDAQ 100 hitting an all-time high of 16,800 points in December 2023, marking a year-to-date performance of 54% – the strongest since the dot-com boom of 1999. A staggering 92% of the stocks in the NASDAQ 100 index rose above their respective 50-day moving averages, indicating widespread gains in the tech sector.
 Leading tech companies like Apple Inc. AAPL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, and Alphabet Inc. GOOG are expected to accelerate in 2024 as technologies such as cloud and AI provide ""a 1995 moment,"" according to Ives.
 Notably, the Nasdaq has soared over 43% over 12 months. Individual tech giants have given higher returns. Apple stock shot up 48%, while Google parent’s Class C shares were up 58% in a similar period. Microsoft shares rallied almost 57% as well in the same time frame.
 The surge in shares of Semiconductor and AI stocks has even been larger. Nvidia Corp NVDA shares gained nearly 240% over the last 12 months, while Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR returned 167%.
 On the last day of trading in 2023, the Nasdaq closed at 15,011.35, if Ives’ predictions are correct, the tech-heavy index will have to trudge up another 33% to reach the 20,000 mark.
 The bullish sentiment is echoed by Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, who predicts a 1990s-like surge in tech stocks, driven by the transformative potential of artificial intelligence.

Is this a sign of a strained market with valuations running too hot and prompting investors to take profits?
 Bank of America said it remained bullish on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) for 2024, despite its 65% gain in 2023.
 The iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, an exchange traded fund that tracks the Philly Semiconductor Index, fell 5.4% over the past two sessions but, like the index it tracks, was up 65% in 2023.
 “The key question for investors,” said BofA analyst Vivek Arya, “is whether 2024 will bring more of the same, or rotation into last year’s laggards.”

 The main risks for the semiconductor sector, according to BofA, are:
 Arya added reasons to be bullish on the sector, included:
 BofA noted that even though the Philly Semi index had a powerful rally in 2023, historically it continued to outperform following such gains.
 The chart below shows that since 1995, the index exceeded 35% annual gains 10 times and delivered double-digit gains following six of those.
 Arya concluded secular tailwinds persisted: “Continued adoption and investment in AI infrastructure, growing chip design complexity, automotive semiconductor content proliferation and government focus on silicon independence will continue to drive the sector in 2024.”

 Although the company is a leader in accelerated computing and is likely to generate “impressive 20% CAGR off of 2022 levels across cycles,” the out-year consensus expectations appear too high, according to DA Davidson.
 The Nvidia Analyst: Gil Luria initiated coverage of Nvidia with a Neutral rating and price target of $410.
 Check out other analyst stock ratings.
 The Nvidia Thesis: While AI is the most significantly transformative technology since the Internet, the level of investments in its development in 2023 is unlikely to continue to be as elevated beyond 2024, Luria said in the initiation note.
 Nvidia has exposure to the AI hype, which is approaching the “trough of disillusion,” the analyst stated.
 “While our CY24 estimates have customers filling in their GenAI capacity, our CY25 estimates are Street low as we expect the big dropoff to happen in this timeframe,” Luria wrote. “Therefore, we see NVDA as a sum of a core accelerated computing business growing sustainably 20% off of 2022 levels and a “GenAI sandbox” company that is unlikely to sustain current levels,” he added.
 NVDA Price Action: Shares of Nvidia had declined by 0.9% to $477.42 at the time of publication on Wednesday.

Microsoft, Palantir, and CrowdStrike are potential winners in 2024.",benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/01/36474257/ais-2024-reality-check-facing-peak-ai-hype-its-time-to-prove-its-worth,"['AMD', 'CRWD', 'INTL', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'PLTR']",2024-01-03 17:20:17+00:00,NVDA,"AI's 2024 Reality Check: Facing 'Peak AI Hype,' It's Time To Prove Its Worth - CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) - Benzinga","Artificial Intelligence (AI) was one of the major themes of 2023, wowing investors with increasingly innovative use cases and capturing headlines with demonstrations of how it will become a disruptive force in global industry.
 In 2024, however, it’s likely the technology will have to start proving its worth on the bottom line as investors increasingly seek proof that the billions spent on AI development can make a return on investment.
 Alex Zukin, tech analyst at Wolfe Research, wrote last month: “We are at peak AI hype with a likely slide into the trough of disillusionment, as actual GenAI revenue dollars take longer to materialize.”
 Many of the top gainers of 2023 have strong links with AI: chipmakers, such as Nvidia NVDA and Intel INTL increasingly focused on the next generation of semiconductors that will provide the processing power for new generative AI (GenAI) models.
 Indeed, Nvidia, with an outstanding annual gain of more than 220%, was the best performing stock on the S&P 500 in 2023, while rivals AMD AMD and Intel came in with annual gains of 115% and 73% respectively.

 Can they keep up these performances in 2024? So far, all three are down during the first two trading sessions of 2024. It’s highly probable that this is little more than profit taking after such a mighty run, but the correction could have further to go.
 Microsoft MSFT, which has invested a whopping $13 billion in OpenAI, will be expecting the headlines in 2023 to be about how well its AI partner is contributing to its bottom line, rather than the antics of the OpenAI board and its founder Sam Altman — as was the case in 2023.
 In its last quarterly earnings review, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, said: “We are really focused on making sure that every dollar we commit is back to the priorities we talked about, which is commercial cloud leadership and leading the AI wave.”
 Shares in Microsoft gained 56% in 2023, but have lost 1.1% in the past two trading sessions.
 Keith Noonan, writing for the Motley Fool, believes that Nvidia and Microsoft remain among the best AI stocks to buy for 2024.
 “While some smaller companies will undoubtedly emerge as winners, the competitive advantages granted by infrastructure and data strengths suggest the AI race will continue to favor large players,” he said.
 Other potential winners in 2024 may have to display a proven track record. 
 Outside the mega-cap stocks stands Palantir Technologies PLTR which, during November and December when all other stocks were soaring, tumbled following a badly-received contract with Britain’s National Health Service.
 Despite this, its shares were up nearly 150% during 2023, and analysts believe it remains undervalued at $16 compared with its 2020 peak at nearly $40. 
 The company boasts many high-ranking government contracts and launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform last May. By November, the platform had attracted around 300 organizations as customers.
 One of the most cited use cases for AI has been in the field of cybersecurity. Among the leaders here, and already using the technology to combat cybercrime, is CrowdStrike CRWD. Its shares have also enjoyed a stellar 2023 with gains of 134%.
 Whether they can resume their rally in the next few weeks will largely depend on the quality of earnings they report over the coming quarters.

 A new report reveals how several members of Congress outperformed the overall market, and also shares some of the top stocks and sectors picked the most by those in office.
 What Happened: Many stock indexes ended 2023 trading at all-time highs or near all-time highs, with 2023 turning into a rebound year for investors after a down 2022.
 A new report released by Unusual Whales highlighted the top traders in Congress with Brian Higgins (D-N.Y.) taking the crown with a 238.9% gain from 2023 trades.
 The report found that 32 members of Congress beat the performance of the S&P 500, which is tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY. Republicans posted average gains of 17.99 and Democrats had average gains of 31.18% compared to the 24.8% gain for the S&P 500.
 The report highlighted some of the top sectors and stocks that members of Congress traded most often in 2023.

 Top Sectors in 2023: The report highlights that the performance by political party may have been related to sector selection with many Democrats trading technology stocks and many Republicans trading financials, oil stocks and commodities that underperformed in 2023.
 The top overall sectors bought in 2023 shared in the report were:
 The top overall sectors sold in 2023 were:
 While financial services was a top sector among sales in 2023, several disclosures by members of Congress with sales of bank stocks timed near the collapse of several banks drew increased attention from the public.
 Technology led the way in 2023 with members of Congress actively buying and selling top performers in the sector.
 Another trade theme that often drew attention was shorting the market, which was done several times by several members of Congress, including Representative Thomas Carper (D-Del.) who used short ETFs to bet against the market. The moves come as Carper serves on the Senate Finance Committee.
 Top Stocks in 2023: Unusual Whales collaborated on two Congress Trading-themed ETFs in 2023, which allow investors a chance to invest alongside the members of Congress.
 The ETFs are the Unusual Whales Subversive Democratic Trading ETF NANC and the Unusual Whales Subversive Republican Trading ETF KRUZ.
 The new report from Unusual Whales highlights the top stocks that were bought and sold by members of Congress in 2023.
 The top 10 stocks bought by members of the House of Representatives were:
 The top 10 stocks sold by members of the House of Representatives were:
 The top 10 stocks bought by members of the Senate were:
 The top 10 stocks sold by members of the Senate were:
 The sector and stock purchases and sales are based on maximum dollars from financial disclosures, which means large transactions by several members of Congress could skew the results of how popular individual sectors and stocks were in 2023.
 The list of stocks and sectors that were bought and sold could illustrate a sense of where certain members of Congress believe the market is headed in 2023 and which sectors could outperform the overall market.

 There is a rumor that a Bitcoin BTC/USD ETF will be approved as soon as tomorrow. The rumor has driven bitcoin above the key level of $45,000. The SEC has until January 10 to make a decision on bitcoin ETFs.
 This morning there is rumor that the SEC may reject spot bitcoin ETF.  Bitcoin fell as low as $40,968. Buyers came in at the low, and bitcoin has since recovered to above $42,000.
 Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is 🔒. This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades.
 It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.
 Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.
 You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.
 It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.  High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.
 Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.
 Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, META, and NVDA.
 Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.
 We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:
 For those optimistic about SPY's SPY prospects, the goal is to see an upward movement beginning at 471.40, aiming for a modest rise to 472.68. Should the market conditions favor the buyers and sustain above 472.68, the aim is to elevate the price to a supportive stance at 473.40. A solid hold at this level during regular market hours might propel the price further to 474.04, with an ambitious target set at 475.02 for the day.
 Conversely, if 471.40 fails to act as a reliable support, the scenario might pivot in favor of the pessimists aiming to pull the value down to 470.63. Observing a downward trend, the next focus will be at 469.17. A breach here might lead to a more pronounced drop to a substantial support at 468.16, with a critical bearish threshold for the day marked at 466.80 if the selling pressure escalates.
 In the context of $QQQ QQQ, if the price hovers around 400.95, the bullish outlook involves surpassing 402.31 and consolidating it as a support base. Success here leads to an aspiration for 403.08 and potentially rallying further to 403.59. A robust buying environment might push the price to challenge 404.76, aiming for an ambitious daily peak at 405.66.
 On the flip side, should the price struggle to maintain above 400.95, it might signal a bearish takeover aiming to push the price down to 399.67. A continued weakness in the market might further depress the price to 398.57, and possibly 396.81. Should the bearish momentum persist, a final descent to the day's pessimistic target of 395.04 might be in sight.
 Apple's AAPL  current positioning near 184.96 sets the stage for bulls to hold this as a support and eye an ascent to 185.86. Should the bullish trend persist, we might see a rally towards 186.35, with a final bullish aspiration for the day reaching 186.99.
 Conversely, if 184.96 fails to provide the needed support, a bearish trajectory might lead to testing lower grounds at 183.38. Further selling pressure could drop the price to 182.96 and then to a more significant level at 181.25. If the bearish momentum intensifies, a final target for the bears is set at 180.60.
 For Microsoft MSFT, holding firm at 368.79 is crucial for bulls, with an immediate target set at 370.10. A sustained position above this level might encourage a rally towards 372.03, with an ambitious end-of-day goal at 373.48.
 If the bears take over and 368.79 fails as support, the price might be pushed to 366.98. A further downtrend could lead to 365.35, with a significant bearish sentiment possibly pulling the value down to 363.81 as the day's low.
 Tesla TSLA enthusiasts aim for an upward trajectory from 246.16 to 248.37, with subsequent targets at 250.25 and 252.38. A particularly bullish day might see Tesla's price soaring to an impressive 254.28.
 However, if Tesla's price cannot sustain 246.16 as a strong support, a bearish pattern might emerge, driving the price to 243.98 and possibly further to 242.49. A continued sell-off could push the day's low to 239.92.
 For Alphabet GOOGL, maintaining 137.79 as a support level is vital for a bullish scenario, eyeing an initial rise to 138.39, and possibly extending the rally to a high of 139.46.
 Should the price fail to hold above 136.94, bears might drive it down to 136.29 and, with increased selling pressure, further to 135.66. A significant bearish sentiment could end the day at a low of 134.96.
 Meta's META trading strategy includes maintaining strength above 342.89 and aiming for 345.04. A strong buying environment could further elevate the price to 347.67, with the highest bullish target for the day at 350.18.
 However, if 342.89 doesn't hold up, bears might lead the price down to 341.85, with further potential downtrends to 340.66 and, if the selling continues, to a bearish end-of-day target of 337.17.
 For NVIDIA NVDA, the bullish path involves a rally from 473.81 to 476.94, securing it as a firm support before aiming for 478.67. The ultimate bullish goal for the day is set at 481.27.
 If 473.81 doesn't serve as a solid foundation, bears might attempt to lower the price to 470.17. A sustained sell-off could lead to a further descent to 467.34, with a potential day's low marked at 461.49.
 Final Word:  Keep an eye on the premarket activities, including remarks from Richmond Fed's Thomas Barkin and the release of critical economic data during regular trading hours. The FOMC Minutes in the afternoon are also pivotal. Stay alert and disciplined in your trading approach. Best of luck!

 The Dutch government's action targets the NXT:2050i and NXT:2100i systems, which are crucial in producing advanced microprocessors.
 Nvidia commands a 90% share in China's AI chip market, valued at $7 billion.
 As the new year unfolds, Nvidia and other tech giants are part of a more optimistic Wall Street outlook. Contrary to last year's skepticism, stocks rose significantly in 2023, driven by the emergence of artificial intelligence and a more resilient economy than expected, avoiding the anticipated recession. 
 The S&P 500 is now very close to a record high, reflecting a dramatic shift in investor sentiment, the Wall Street Journal reports.
 Investors are increasingly convinced that the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting measures are nearing an end, likely shifting from rate hikes to cuts. 
 This policy change alters market dynamics, offering a more favorable outlook than previous expectations. However, potential risks like economic shocks or political uncertainties could lead to market volatility.
 The year 2023 ended with a broad-based rally across various asset classes, lifting stocks, bonds, gold, and even cryptocurrencies. 
 The S&P 500 saw a return of 24%, and Wall Street's fear index, the Cboe Volatility Index, indicated low market stress levels.
 Fund managers surveyed in December expressed a high level of optimism, the most since early 2022. 
 A significant majority anticipate the Fed will stop raising interest rates, with many expecting lower bond yields within a year. Corporate bonds, in particular, are seen as an attractive investment opportunity.
 Wall Street forecasts robust corporate earnings growth, projecting an 11.6% increase for S&P 500 companies in the new year. 
 However, there's skepticism about the future performance of major tech companies, known as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which includes Nvidia, Apple Inc AAPL, Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL, Amazon.Com Inc AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc META, Microsoft Corp MSFT, and Tesla Inc TSLA. 
 These companies dominated the market in 2023, but their future potential remains debatable among investors.
 Overall, the market outlook for 2024 is cautiously optimistic, with expectations of interest rate cuts and opportunities in various sectors despite potential risks from the presidential election and policy shifts.
 DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria initiated coverage on Nvidia with a Neutral rating and a price target of $410.
 Price Actions: NVDA shares traded lower by 0.02 % at $481.10 on the last check Wednesday. AMD shares traded lower by 1.73% at $136.18.

Cruise Operators And Chip Stocks Targeted In Profit Taking - Applied Mat (NASDAQ:AMAT), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) - Benzinga","After the stunning rally that ended 2023, investors started 2024 with sobering losses that appeared to reflect the darkening geopolitical outlook.
 There were some heavy losses across Asia on Tuesday — particularly in China, where weak home sales data undermined the property sector. In the U.S., the mega-cap Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out narrow gains, but both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ indexes lost ground.
 The SDPR S&P 500 Fund SPY, the exchange traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 fell 0.6% on Tuesday and the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ which tracks tech stocks on the NASDAQ 100 fell 1.7%. Premarket trading on both ETFs indicated opening losses on Wednesday.

 The news from the Middle East and Red Sea were certainly sobering. Maersk AMKBY, the shipping company which last week had decided to resume routes through the Red Sea, suffered another attack by Houthi rebels. U.S. warships engaged with enemy vessels, while Iran sent a cruiser to the region.
 It was later reported that Israel had killed the deputy leader of Hamas in a drone strike on a building in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon.
 This incident, being Israel’s first incursion outside of Gaza in this conflict, raises concerns about the potential involvement of Lebanese Hezbollah militants and their allies, including Iran and Syria, further intensifying regional tensions.
 Yet the market action didn’t feel like a reaction to geopolitical events. Gold prices fell, as the tradition safe haven asset did not attract spooked buyers. The iShares Gold Trust ETF IAU fell 0.2%.
 “Geopolitical tensions remain high but do not seem to be having a direct market influence as both gold and oil are trading lower,” said Marc Chandler at Bannockburn Global.
 Looking at the losers on the S&P 500 — including the Magnificent Seven stocks, which all lost between 1% and 5% — and it was a list of the best performers of 2023.
 “I wouldn’t have been surprised to see profit taking — you’ve got a lot of portfolio managers who underperformed their index, so they’re re-orientating their portfolios towards a less hawkish Fed — they need to allocate towards stocks,” said Tom Lee at Fundstrat, in an interview on CNBC on Tuesday.
 The largest downturns on the S&P 500 on Tuesday were seen in the three cruise line operators: Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings NCLH fell 8.6%, Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL lost 7.2% and Carnival Corp CCL shed 6.7%.
 During 2023, only three stocks — including Mag7 giants Nvidia NVDA up 227%, and Meta Platforms META up 172% — outperformed Royal Caribbean, which gained 128% over the year. Carnival wasn’t far behind with an annual gain of 98%, while NCLH rose by 47%.
 Another big story of 2023 — the growth of artificial intelligence — drove semiconductor stocks to cyclical highs, and many of these stocks were among Tuesday’s big losers.
 AMD AMD fell 6%, Intel INTL shed 4.9% and Applied Materials AMAT lost 4.8%.
 Premarket trading on Wednesday indicated the likelihood of further equity losses — particularly in the stocks mentioned above. 
 But the selling has not been broad based. There were plenty of gainers, particularly in the pharmaceuticals, healthcare and financial sectors.
 Capex has risen during 2023, indicating companies feel confident about their earnings growth in 2024 — and earnings will be the ultimate driver, along with Federal Reserve policy, as the year advances.
 Thus, the fourth-quarter 2023 earnings season, which kicks off in a few weeks, will be key for investment decision-making as companies provide further details on their outlooks for the coming year.

",benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/01/36467010/apple-suppliers-see-share-price-drop-as-barclays-downgrades-iphone-maker,"['AAPL', 'HNHPF', 'HXSCL', 'NVDA']",2024-01-03 12:38:04+00:00,NVDA,"Apple Suppliers See Share Price Drop As Barclays Downgrades iPhone Maker - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Hon Hai Precision (OTC:HNHPF) - Benzinga","In a recent development, shares of Apple’s AAPL suppliers took a hit following Barclays downgrade of the tech behemoth due to a potential decrease in product demand in 2024.
 What Happened: CNBC reported on Tuesday that the shares of suppliers associated with Apple in Asia experienced a drop after the Barclays downgrade. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a top-tier manufacturer of advanced processors for companies such as Apple and Nvidia NVDA, saw a more than 2% decline in shares during morning trading. Foxconn HNHPF, a major Apple supplier and the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturer, also experienced a 1.33% drop in shares.

 Moreover, tech and chip stocks such as Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix HXSCL dropped over 2%, while LG Electronics fell 1.78%, leading to a 1.85% drop in South Korea’s Kospi. This situation developed after Barclays demoted Apple’s stock to underweight on Tuesday and lowered its price target to $160 from $161, citing weak iPhone 15 sales and a potential decrease in demand for iPhone 16 and other products. Consequently, Apple’s shares ended the day 3.58% lower.
 Despite the downgrade, experts in the industry maintain that Apple’s suppliers continue to see strong growth. 
 “There’s still 200 to 300 million iPhones that get replaced onto 5G, at least for the next 24 months,” stated Ray Wang of Constellation Research on CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia.” 
 In a report dated Jan. 3, UBS claimed that TSMC is “poised for a strong rebound in 2024” and sustained a buy rating, albeit with a lowered price target.
 Why It Matters: Apple’s $85 billion services business faces potential impacts from a series of legal and regulatory rulings expected in 2024. Furthermore, Apple’s stock was downgraded by Barclay‘s analyst Tim Long from Equal-Weight to Underweight, resulting in a lower price target.

 What Happened: Cramer on Tuesday predicted that investors might move away from the leading Magnificent Seven tech stocks to invest in sectors that have experienced significant declines, like the food and pharmaceutical industries, reported CNBC.
 Cramer stated, “My crystal ball suggests that profits will be taken from the best of the best, including the Magnificent Seven and friends, as well as the richly valued software enterprise names. I think investors will use that cash to invest in companies that haven’t gotten any respect for ages.”

 Cramer warned that this shift might be temporary, with investors potentially returning to their December favorites once earnings reports are released.
 Cramer believes that the Federal Reserve’s decisions will greatly impact Wall Street activity. He suggests investors should choose stocks from companies with strong leadership and reasonable valuations instead of focusing solely on potential Fed-induced recession fears.
 Cramer’s advice to investors is to “wait patiently for the sell-off that I’m expecting and then do some buying.”
 Why It Matters: Cramer’s recent advice of waiting for a pullback before investing in overvalued stocks seems to align with his earlier prediction in December. His cautionary stance on tech stocks, such as the case with Cloudflare Inc NET, was clear when he suggested that investors had arrived late to the party.
 The renowned Magnificent Seven, a term used to describe a cluster of high-growth tech firms, began 2024 on an unstable footing, witnessing a collective market cap decline of $250 billion during the initial trading session of the year. Shares of Apple Inc. AAPL experienced the sharpest sell-off — over 4%. The other six tech titans — Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOG GOOGL, Amazon Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc. META, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Tesla, Inc. TSLA — also saw their market caps decrease.

 The downturn began on Dec. 28, 2023 when the Nasdaq 100 hit all-time highs of 16,696 during the session but closed down 0.05%. Since then, there have been only negative closures, culminating in Thursday’s session. The Nasdaq 100 has lost a total of 4.1% over five consecutive sessions. 
 The last time such a negative streak occurred was between Oct. 5 and 12, 2022 when the Nasdaq 100 experienced seven red sessions.
 The primary contributors to the Nasdaq 100’s negative streak are the shares of the “Magnificent Seven”: Apple Inc. AAPL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOG GOOGL, Amazon Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc. META, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Tesla, Inc. TSLA. 
 Together, these seven stocks, which account for nearly 35% of the Nasdaq index, have lost an average of 4% in the last five sessions, with Tesla, Apple and Amazon down by almost 6%.
 Overall, the market value lost by the Magnificent Seven in the past week amounts to $456 billion.

 Many of 2023’s leaders, including the ""Magnificent Seven"" mega-cap tech stocks — Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — have sold off as investors appear to be taking gains after last year’s rally. 
 See Also: Tech Titans Tumble: 'Magnificent Seven' Shed $250 Billion in Market Cap On 2024 Day One
 Is the start-of-the-year sell-off just a healthy pullback or a sign of things to come for the entire year?
 Let’s dive into the data. 
 The Nasdaq had only opened the year down more than 1% on the first two trading days twice before this week: 1980 and 2005. In both of those years, the tech-heavy index ended the year higher, although 2005 was relatively flat. But in 1980, despite the sluggish start, the Nasdaq Composite closed the year up nearly 34%, according to Nasdaq. 
 Bespoke also points out that many of the leaders of 2023 are the names experiencing pullbacks to start the year. Apple Inc AAPL is down nearly 3% since the start of the year, while other mega-cap tech stocks such as Microsoft Corp MSFT and NVIDIA Corp NVDA have also stumbled out of the gates. 
 January is typically just an average month for stocks, ranking as the sixth-best month for S&P 500 returns since 1950, according to Carson Group’s Ryan Detrick.
 Detrick also pointed out that mild pullbacks, like the one we’ve seen in the S&P 500 to start the year, typically happen multiple times a year, so it may not be something to worry about — at least not yet.

However, Marc Chaikin, founder and CEO of Chaikin Analytics, believes that this does not signify an end to the rally that began in late October.
 During his appearance on Benzinga PreMarket Prep, Chaikin highlighted his perspective, especially for the 493 stocks in the S&P 500 that fall outside the realm of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech giants. He pointed out that this period could be particularly significant for these stocks, suggesting potential opportunities outside the tech sector.
 Despite a small gain during Thursday morning, the broad market index remains 1.1% lower since 2024 trading began on Tuesday. The exchange traded fund that tracks the index, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY is down by the same amount.
 Chaikin puts this in context by explaining that on Tuesday, when the S&P 500 fell by 1%, there were more stocks that gained than stocks that lost. Because of the huge weighting of the Mag7 — Amazon.com Inc AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc META, Nvidia Inc NVDA et al — the market was lower.
 “If you’ve taken profits, you’ve got to look for the opportunities to get back in to the market,” Chaikin said.

 Chaikin said that there’s more upward potential for the markets, anticipating that the S&P 500 will not only breach its all-time high but will also continue to climb further. He observes a technical analysis tool called the McClellan Summation Index which, on the S&P 500, has moved over 1,000.
 “This index only gets over 1,000 at the beginning of bull markets — not in bear markets, and not at the end of anything. So that’s telling you there’s a lot more upside,” Chaikin said.
 “It summarizes the mood of the market and the flow of funds into stocks,” he added. “In the S&P 500, the Summation index went to a level that’s only been seen one other time. And in this case, you can’t take a contrarian view to that.”
 Chaikin Analytics employs a Power Gauge rating that Chaikin himself developed, which scans the market each day for stocks displaying strong price and volume activity then assigns a rating: bullish, neutral or bearish.
 In the pharma sector, Chaikin says that Pfizer Inc PFE, which has underperformed its peers over the past year, has just turned bullish on the Power Gauge.
 Regarding Eli Lilly And Co LLY, a stock that surged 72% in 2023 driven by its weight-loss drugs, Chaikin advises, “I would definitely be a seller here — the stock’s trading at 100 times earnings.”
 But his current favorites are among the industrials, consumer discretionary, financials, materials, and very selective, lesser named tech stocks.
 “One mid-cap name that I really like is Boise Cascade Co BCC,” he said. The company is a producer of wood products and supplier to the construction industry.
 He also likes 3M Co MMM, the company that is still in the middle of multiple lawsuits for supplying earplugs to the military that didn’t work properly.
 “Look at the chart on 3M and the double top at the $200 area in 2019 and 2022. The stock is currently trading with a 5.5% dividend yield at $110 — that’s a lot of upside,” he said.
 “They always come up with something like a Post-It-Note — some innovative product that drives the top line revenue,” Chaikin added.

A look back at the famous tattoo.,benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/24/01/36494632/if-you-invested-1-000-in-nvidia-stock-when-jensen-huang-got-company-logo-tattoo-heres-how-much-,"['NVDA', 'SPY']",2024-01-04 16:56:39+00:00,NVDA,"If You Invested $1,000 In NVIDIA Stock When Jensen Huang Got Company Logo Tattoo, Here's How Much You'd Have Today - NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) - Benzinga","A surge in artificial intelligence interest and use cases helped propel NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion.
 The impressive milestone helped boost the wealth of company CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang. While Huang previously got a tattoo to celebrate a company milestone years ago, there is no tattoo planned to celebrate the company being worth $1 trillion.
 What Happened: Shares of Nvidia gained more than 200% in 2023, one of the best returns by a large capitalization stock for the year, boosted by the strong performance of artificial intelligence stocks. 
 Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 and still leads the company today. The soaring stock price helped boost the wealth of Huang, adding $30.2 billion to take his wealth to $44.0 billion in 2023, ranking as the 29th richest person in the world.
 Before Nvidia hit a $1 trillion market cap, another milestone was hit years ago with shares passing the $100 level. That level would be reached several times with shares splitting multiple times since 2000.
 To celebrate the occasion of shares hitting $100, Huang promised company executives he would get the Nvidia logo as a tattoo.
 In a 2017 interview with Fortune, Huang revealed the tattoo and shared more details on it.
 ""So, I really want to extend it. I actually kinda do. I would love to. But getting it really, really hurt,"" Huang said.
 Huang said his family was with him when he got his tattoo.
 ""I was crying like a baby. My kids were with me, and they were like, ‘Dad, you've gotta control yourself.'""
 Huang recalled a semi-annual meeting years ago being the reason for the tattoo.
 ""And at one, someone said, ‘What are we gonna do when the stock price hits $100?'""
 Huang recalled that others said they would shave their head, paint their hair a new color, get a mohawk and even get a nipple ring.
 ""So I said, ‘Yeah all right, I'll get a tattoo.'""
 The first picture of the tattoo that can be found online of Huang's tattoo comes from the Nvidia Gaming Festival with a post on Nvidia's Instagram on Oct. 25, 2014.
 ""NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsu Huang shows off his NVDIA tattoo at the NVIDIA Gaming Festival,"" the post reads.
 It is unknown when exactly Huang got his tattoo, but it doesn't sound like there will be more added to his arms anytime soon.
 ""Ageing gracefully. No more tattoos. It hurts way more than anybody tells you,"" Huang said in a 2023 interview.

 Investing $1,000 in Nvidia Stock: With the date unknown when exactly Huang got his tattoo, a starting point of when the tattoo was unveiled to the public can be used.
 The Nvidia Instagram post with Huang's tattoo was shared on Oct. 25, 2014, which fell on the weekend. Shares opened at a split-adjusted $4.62 the following Monday.
 A $1,000 investment could have bought 216.45 NVDA shares. The $1,000 investment would be worth $103,380.85 today. This represents a potential return of 10,238.1%.
 Compare that to a $1,000 investment in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, which could have bought 5.11 SPY shares at the time. The $1,000 investment would be worth $2,400.83 today, representing a potential return of 140.1%.
 Another point of reference could have been to buy Nvidia shares after the Fortune interview that labeled Huang the Businessperson of the Year and made the tattoo more a storyline to the public.
 A $1,000 investment could have purchased 18.67 shares of Nvidia on Nov. 16, 2017 based on a split-adjusted price of $53.55. The $1,000 investment would be worth $8,917.17 today, representing a return of 791.7%.
 The same $1,000 invested in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust on the same date could have purchased 3.89 SPY shares, which would be worth $1,827.64 today. This represents a return of 82.8%.
 Jim Cramer once named a dog after Nvidia based on the strong stock returns and Huang has a tattoo to mark the occasion. With a soaring stock price in 2023 and over the last 10 years, investors are likely happy to be following the story that is Nvidia.

 The chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
 Note the following:
 The Middle East tinderbox just got hotter.  About 100 people died in a terror attack in Iran in a gathering remembering a top Iranian general killed by the U.S.  In The Arora Report analysis, after this incident, the probability of the Middle East conflict widening has now gone up to 30%.  The momo crowd is oblivious, but prudent investors should pay attention.
 What happens to the stock market will ultimately come down to what happens to inflation.  In Germany, CPI rose to 3.8% year-over-year in line with consensus. However, it is higher than the rise in November.
 In the early trade, money flows are mixed in Alphabet Inc Class C GOOG, Meta Platforms Inc META, Microsoft Corp MSFT, NVIDIA Corp NVDA, and Tesla Inc TSLA
 In the early trade, money flows are negative in AAPL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN.

 API crude inventories came at a draw of 7.418M barrels vs. a consensus of a draw of 2.967M barrels.
 The momo crowd is buying oil in the early trade.  Smart money is 🔒 in the early trade.
 For longer-term, please see oil ratings.
 The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF USO.
 Bitcoin BTC/USD is rising as rumors continue to swirl about spot bitcoin ETFs.
 Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is 🔒.  This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades.
 It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.
 Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.
 You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.  The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.  If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.
 It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.  When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.  High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.
 Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.
 Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.  Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.
 The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.  The Arora Report correctly called the 2008 financial crash, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, the COVID crash, the post-COVID bull market, and the 2022 bear market.  Please click here to sign up for a free forever Generate Wealth Newsletter.

 The chip designer will likely unveil a series of new graphics cards at the upcoming CES event in Las Vegas, generating buzz with a new social media profile photo hinting at the launches. 
 While details of the new card remain undisclosed, rumors suggest introducing three new models: the GeForce RTX 4070 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4080 Super. These releases are in addition to the speculated GeForce RTX 4090 Ti, Forbes reports.
 The RTX 4070 Ti Super will likely receive a significant memory upgrade to 16GB GDDR6X, aligning it with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc's AMD Radeon RX 7000-series cards, which feature a minimum of 16GB. 
 It needs to be clarified how these new introductions will affect the existing market offerings. However, the RTX 4080 Super and RTX 4070 Ti Super will likely replace the RTX 4080 and RTX 4070 Ti, respectively, while the RTX 4070 and RTX 4070 Super will coexist now.
 MSI's recent leak seems to confirm these three new GeForce RTX Super cards, with the RTX 4070 Ti Super slated to receive a memory upgrade to 16GB, Forbes said. 
 The expected announcement dates for these new models are January 8 for the RTX 4070 Super, January 17 for the RTX 4070 Super, January 24 for the RTX 4070 Ti Super, and January 31 for the RTX 4080 Super. Alongside Nvidia, Intel Corp INTC and AMD will likely make significant announcements at CES, capturing the interest of PC and laptop gamers and enthusiasts.
 Nvidia is also preparing for the mass production of its AI chips, including the H20 model, targeting the Chinese market in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Nvidia selected Taiwanese electronics company Wistron as the primary supplier for the graphics processing unit (GPU) substrates needed for these chips, TechNode reports. 
 This move is significant in the context of the U.S. government's ban on exporting high-performance AI chips. Despite these restrictions, Nvidia has tailored its latest AI chips based on Nvidia's H100 model. Nvidia commands a 90% share in China's AI chip market, valued at $7 billion.
 Nvidia will likely play a pivotal role in advancing India's AI capabilities, as the Hiranandani Group's Yotta Data Services aims to build India's largest supercomputer, Shakti Cloud. 
 This endeavor could place Shakti Cloud among the world's top ten supercomputers. 
 To achieve this, Yotta is procuring 16,000 Nvidia H100 Tensor GPUs, a significant move given Nvidia's dominant market share and the current global shortage of these GPUs, Business Today reports.
 This breakthrough came after a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang.
 They discussed bridging India's AI gap and supporting local providers with technology and expertise. 
 Yotta's initial plan involves installing the Nvidia GPUs in its Mumbai data center, followed by Greater Noida and Gift City expansions. 
 The project requires advanced data center engineering, including liquid and immersion cooling systems, to handle the GPUs' power needs.
 Yotta will start with 4,096 GPUs in February 2024, which will increase to 16,384 by June 2024 and potentially 32,768 by the end of 2025.
 Price Actions: NVDA shares traded higher by 0.99% at $480.40 on the last check Thursday.

In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, META, and NVDA.
 Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.
 We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:
 SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY The SPY is currently near 469.17. Bulls are looking for an upward push starting at 470.63, targeting a follow-through to 471.40. Maintaining strength above this could lead to higher levels, with aspirations for 472.68, and eventually reaching a day's high target of 473.40. 
 If support at 469.17 fails, bears will likely aim to lower prices, first testing 468.16. A breach below could lead to further declines at 467.51, and if the downtrend continues, targets may extend down to 466.80, with an end-of-day bearish aim at 465.35.
 Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ The Q's are trading around 399.67. For bulls, holding above 400.95 is crucial, aiming next for 402.31 and then 403.08. If momentum sustains, a push towards 403.59 could occur, with a bullish daily high at 404.76. 
 Conversely, if the Q's cannot maintain above 399.67, bears may drive the market to test 398.57. With continued weakness, a further decline to 396.81 might ensue, potentially leading to 395.04 and a bearish extreme at 393.96 for the day.
 Apple Inc. AAPL Apple's trading level is around 183.38. In a bullish scenario, holding this as support would be key, aiming for an upward trajectory through 184.59 and further to 184.96. Should the buying persist, the day's high target for Apple could be 185.86. 
 Should Apple fail to maintain 183.38 as support, the bears might look to push the stock lower, first testing 182.96. Continued bearish sentiment could lead to further declines at 181.25 and 180.60, with a bearish end-of-day target set at 180.10.
 Microsoft Corp. MSFT Microsoft is around the 372.03 mark. For bulls, sustaining above this level is crucial, aiming for an initial rally to 373.48 and then on to 375.11. A strong bullish day might conclude at a high target of 375.93. 
 If 372.03 doesn't hold up as support, bears might take the opportunity to push down to 370.10. Continued pressure could lead to further declines at 368.79 and 366.98, with the bearish day target at 365.35.
 Tesla Inc. TSLA Tesla is currently trading near 239.92. Bulls will be eyeing an upward move to 242.49, hoping to continue the rally to 243.98 and possibly further to 246.16. The ambitious target for a bullish day is set at 248.37. 
 On the other hand, if Tesla fails to hold 239.92, the bearish trajectory might lead to 238.50. Further selling could bring the stock down to 235.74, and in a more aggressive downtrend, the price might fall to a bearish day's target of 233.49.
 Alphabet Inc Class A GOOGL Alphabet's position is around 139.46. In a bullish market, the focus would be on climbing past 140.05 and extending gains to a high target of 140.57. 
 If support at 139.46 breaks, the bearish outlook would see Alphabet's price moving down to 138.39, possibly extending losses to 137.79, and in a heavy sell-off, reaching a low bear target of 136.94.
 Meta Platforms Inc META Meta is auctioning near 345.04. A bullish scenario involves holding above 347.67, advancing towards 350.18, and further aiming for a high target of 353.60. 
 Conversely, if 345.04 doesn't hold, bears might lead the price down to 342.89. With sustained selling pressure, the stock might descend to 341.85, aiming for a bearish day's low at 340.66.
 NVIDIA Corporation NVDA NVIDIA's current level is around 478.67. Bulls will aim for 481.27 and hope to extend gains up to 483.43, with an optimistic target of 485.93 for the day. 
 If the price fails to hold 478.67, bears may target lower levels at 476.94. With increased selling, the price could drop further to 473.81 and, in a bearish market, down to a day's low of 467.34.
 Final Word:  Today's trading activity is likely to be influenced by significant employment data released in the premarket, which may induce market volatility. Throughout the regular New York session, we'll witness the unveiling of December's Final Services PMI and the auction of the Treasury's 4 and 8-week bills. It's essential to monitor trading volumes closely as market participation is expected to rise nearing the conclusion of this first week of 2024. Good luck today and remember to trade with discipline.

Currently, the company is at a critical juncture as it navigates through an evolving semiconductor market. While the company touts progress in AI-driven memory chips and its bid for a substantial share of the HBM memory market, formidable rival Samsung‘s impending entry looms large, setting a cautious tone for Micron’s future.
 Despite strides in production ramp-ups highlighted in Micron’s recent fiscal first quarter (FQ1’24) earnings conference, management’s tempered approach reflects a keen awareness of past overspending pitfalls. The burgeoning AI chips revolution that spurred NVIDIA Corp NVDA to new heights (up 232% over the past year), has also buoyed Micron’s recovery to a good extent. Micron’s stock is up 63% over a one-year period.

 Despite Micron’s stock surging nearly 70% in 2023 amid a revenue decline of about 40%, underlying challenges persist. Micron’s trajectory hinges on executing recovery plans while adeptly navigating Samsung’s aggressive foray. The stock’s exuberance in recent years without revenue growth hints at market expectations that might not align with industry realities.
 Also Read: Why Micron Technology Shares Are Falling
 The near-to-medium-term profitability metrics for Micron remain clouded. While the current supply/demand balance favors memory players, Samsung’s anticipated robust participation poses a potential game-changer. 
 Samsung’s aggressive aspirations and advanced packaging challenges, introduces uncertainties. Particularly in the HBM memory chips segment, where Micron aims to challenge the dominance of SK Hynix. Reports speculating on Samsung potentially outstripping SK Hynix’s HBM production by the second half of 2024 highlight the intense competitive landscape that Micron faces.

 Market forecasts anticipate a remarkable recovery for Micron through FY25, with estimated adjusted EBITDA demonstrating substantial year-over-year growth. Yet, this optimism is juxtaposed with concerns of whether the market has adequately factored in Samsung’s potentially aggressive strides. 
 Micron’s current EV/EBITDA (FWD) multiple of just 13.4 (against sector median of 15.05) suggests that the markets may not be fully accounting for Micron’s forthcoming recovery amid intensifying competition. Micron currently stands at the crossroads, facing a challenging path to recovery in the highly competitive semiconductor industry.

 Intel Corp INTC appointed Justin Hotard as the new Executive Vice President and General Manager of its Data Center and AI Group, effective February 1, 2024. 
 With over two decades of experience in the computing and data center sectors, Hotard is known for his expertise in scaling AI systems for enterprises. 
 He joined Intel from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co HPE as the executive vice president and general manager of high-performance computing, AI, and labs.
 At Intel, Hotard will oversee critical products, including the Xeon server processors, which are crucial to data centers but currently face competition from rivals and in-house customer developments.
 Hotard's role also includes leading Intel's endeavors in graphics and accelerator chips, aiming to challenge Nvidia Corp's NVDA dominance in AI, Bloomberg reports.

 This appointment is a strategic move for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who is focused on revitalizing the company's leadership in the chip industry, notes Bloomberg. 
 Despite their lower volume, data center products are highly profitable due to the high prices of processors and accelerators, making them a crucial segment for Intel.
 Before his tenure at HPE, Hotard held significant roles at NCR Small Business, Symbol Technologies, and Motorola. 
 He is an alumnus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, holding a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering, and he also earned an MBA from the MIT Sloan School of Management.
 Hotard replaces Sandra Rivera, who recently transitioned to CEO of the Programmable Solutions Group, an independent business unit within Intel.
 In related news, Intel also announced the departure of Arun Subramaniyan from its data center unit. Subramaniyan will lead Articul8, a new AI company created by Intel in collaboration with investors such as DigitalBridge Group Inc DBRG and Mindset Ventures.
 Price Action: INTC shares are trading lower by 3.62% at $45.35 premarket on the last check Thursday.

 What Happened: Zuckerberg, who owns about 13% of Meta, sold shares on every trading day from Nov. 1 through the year’s end, Bloomberg reported, citing Tuesday regulatory filing. 
 This massive sale came after a period of two years where the tech mogul had not sold any Meta shares. During this hiatus, Meta’s stock price reached its lowest in seven years.
 The report reveals that Zuckerberg sold almost 1.28 million shares, with each sale averaging $10.4 million. The largest single sale was made on Dec. 28, amounting to $17.1 million.

 In 2023, the company’s share price rebounded, increasing by 194% from a seven-year low near the end of 2022. This surge in stock price saw Meta outperform all other major tech giants, barring Nvidia Corp. NVDA.
 Currently, Zuckerberg holds a net worth of approximately $125 billion, making him the seventh-richest person globally, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. 
 In related news, Marc Benioff, another tech industry heavyweight and co-founder of Salesforce Inc. CRM, also offloaded shares every day in the second half of 2023, selling more than $475 million worth.
 Why It Matters: Zuckerberg’s selling spree began in November last year, when he sold nearly $200 million worth of Meta shares for the first time since 2021. This move coincided with a sharp uptrend in Meta’s stock, which hit a 52-week high during the same period.
 Despite the significant sale, it represented only a small portion of Zuckerberg’s massive wealth. The founder’s decision to sell came after a period of significant growth for Meta, with its stock climbing about 174% in 2023.

 What Happened:  Major chip companies such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD, Qualcomm Inc QCOM, and Broadcom Inc AVGO saw a drop of more than 2%, causing a 2.1% decrease in the PHLX semiconductor index on Wednesday, according to a report by Reuters.
 This comes after a nearly 7% decline in the chip index since setting a new high on Dec. 27. The Federal Reserve's latest minutes from the December meeting showed that policymakers acknowledged that interest rates are likely at or near the cycle's peak, indicating a potential shift in monetary policy as the economic landscape evolves.
 In 2023, the PHLX semiconductor index rose by 65%, driven by enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and expectations that the Fed would reduce interest rates. This performance surpassed both the Nasdaq and S&P 500, which gained 43% and 24% respectively.

 AI chip leader NVIDIA Corp NVDA tripled its stock market value to $1.2 trillion in 2023, making it the fifth most valuable company on Wall Street. However, it also faced a near 1% decline on Wednesday.
 Why It Matters: Despite the recent downturn, Bank of America maintains a bullish stance on the semiconductor industry for 2024, even after a 65% gain in 2023.
 In 2023, chip companies like Nvidia and AMD profited from the crypto boom, with their GPUs becoming crucial for applications like data centers, AI, and crypto asset creation.
 However, escalating US-China trade tensions have added to the sector’s volatility. The White House’s directive to a leading European chipmaker signals these growing tensions, causing a significant dip in semiconductor stocks at the start of 2024.

Friday’s trading session proved to be volatile for the tech index, with intraday highs reaching 16,415 and lows dipping to 16,249.
 Market sentiment was influenced by conflicting economic data released on Friday, alongside remarks made by Richmond Fed Governor Thomas Barkin.
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics released a December jobs report that surpassed expectations. Non-farm payrolls surged by 216,000 for the month, outperforming both the downwardly revised November figure of 173,000 and the anticipated 170,000. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.7%, defying expectations of an increase to 3.8%. Furthermore, average hourly earnings exceeded estimates, rising by 4.1% year-on-year compared to the estimated 3.9%. 
 Economists had mixed reactions to the report, with some noting signs of cooling, mainly attributed to negative revisions in October and November, while others highlighted the continued tightness in the labor market.
 The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a Service PMI survey that fell significantly short of expectations, plummeting by 2.1 points to 50.5 in December, compared to the anticipated 52.5.
 Following these developments, Barkin stated, “the labor market appears to be gradually softening.” He added, “the U.S. is still in a situation where inflation is above the Fed’s target, and employment is near its maximum.”

 Wall Street is facing its first weekly loss after nine-straight gains, leaving traders anxiously speculating about the future – whether this signals further losses or a resurgence of the rally.
 Traditionally, the “Santa Rally” often extends into January, typically a favorable month for stocks. Although we’re just a week into the month, so there’s still potential for a positive outcome. Let’s explore some key themes that could help settle some nerves.
 While the VIX Volatility Index, often referred to as the “Wall Street fear gauge,” experienced a slight increase over the week, it fell on Friday and continues to stay well under the 20 mark — a threshold commonly viewed by traders as indicative of heightened fear.
 Thus, traders are not running headlong for the doors. Traditional safety measures such as reallocation to bonds and gold were not significant. The 10-year Treasury yield ticked back above 4% on Friday but only fractionally.
 Meanwhile, gold, which had been experiencing an uptrend alongside equity markets amid a weakening dollar, saw a decline this week.

 After the stellar run that followed the October Federal Reserve meeting — when markets finally got clues the central bank was at the end of its rate hike cycle — the S&P 500 was sitting close to its record high.
 The SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, the exchange traded fund that most closely matches the index, was up too, having gained 16% between late October and the end of December.
 Such was the strength of the rally, investors who would usually engage in end-of-year tax harvesting — explained here — held off to enjoy further market gains.
 On Wednesday, Todd Campbell, a writer for TheStreet Smarts, tweeted that last month, investors postponed realizing gains to reduce their tax liabilities. With the arrival of the new month, they have started to lock in some profits, which is resulting in a decline in the markets. Campbell also referenced Helene Meisler, a technical analyst with Real Money, who predicts a continued sell-off in stocks as the market addresses overbought conditions.
 Let’s examine some of the stocks that experienced a pullback this week, particularly those that made significant gains in 2023, including the prominent ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech giants.
 The combined market capitalizations of the Mag7 stocks comprise a third of the entire S&P 500’s market weighting. The S&P 500 rallied 25% over the year, but without the Mag7 it would have only been 12%. If the Mag7 were an index in itself, it would have rallied around 75%.
 Thus, when the S&P 500 fell 1% on Monday, more than half of the stocks on the index still enjoyed gains. It was just the weighting of the Mag7 losses that took the index lower.
 Next week is poised to be another tense period for investors as they anticipate the prevailing sentiment that will set the tone for the markets in January 2023.

 The lineup includes the RTX 4070 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4080 Super. The RTX 4070 Super will coexist with the RTX 4070, while the RTX 4080 and RTX 4070 Ti could be replaced by their Super counterparts, as per rumors, the Forbes reports.
 The pricing strategy for the new RTX Super series appears to be competitive. 
 The RTX 4070 Super will likely be priced at $599, offering performance close to the RTX 4070 Ti but at a lower cost. The RTX 4070 Ti Super, projected at $799, is anticipated to deliver performance near the RTX 4080, thanks to increased memory and stream processors. 
 This makes it an attractive option for high-resolution gamers, especially compared to the RTX 4080's higher price point.

 The RTX 4080 Super might be priced around $999 or $1200, closing the gap to the significantly more expensive RTX 4090. 
 This pricing puts Nvidia in direct competition with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc AMD, Radeon RX 7900 XTX, and RX 7900 XT, priced at approximately $950 and $800, respectively.
 In addition to Nvidia, Intel Corp INTC and AMD will likely announce significant developments in Las Vegas, capturing the attention of PC and laptop gamers and enthusiasts. 
 The focus is on performance enhancements and aggressive pricing strategies to capture a larger market share in the competitive graphics card industry.
 Despite U.S. sanctions, Nvidia remains keen on accomplishing its AI chip targets for China while consolidating its position in the U.S. as the dominant chip designer.
 Price Actions: NVDA shares traded higher by 2.02% at $489.67 on the last check Friday.

 The Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a stronger-than-expected December jobs report, with non-farm payrolls rising by 216,000 for the month, surpassing both November’s 173,000 and the anticipated 170,000. The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.7%, below the expected increase to 3.8%, and average hourly earnings exceeded estimates, rising by 4.1% on the year compared to the estimated 3.9%.
 While everything seemed to be pointing toward reduced expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and another session of declines on Wall Street, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a survey on Service PMIs that fell well short of expectations, dropping by 2.1 points to 50.5 in December, compared to the anticipated 52.5.
 Investors subsequently adjusted their rate expectations, leading to lower Treasury yields and renewed support for stocks.
 At 12:50 p.m. in New York, the S&P 500 index was marginally up by 0.1%, while the Nasdaq 100 attempted a rebound, up by 0.2%, after five consecutive red sessions. The Dow Jones blue-chip stocks slipped by 0.2%, while small-cap stocks declined by 0.1%.
 The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY was flat at $467.11, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA fell 0.2% to $373.59 and the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ gained 0.1% to $396.89, according to Benzinga Pro data.
 Sector-wise, the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund XLC rose by 0.4%, outperforming sector peers. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund XLRE underperformed for the third straight session, down 0.7%. 
 Among industries, the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF KRE outperformed, up 1.1%, while clean-energy stocks, as tracked by the Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF PBW, lagged behind, down 1.6%.

 “Every company is going to have to be an AI company,” said Ivan Feinseth, senior partner and CIO at Tigress Financial, while appearing on Benzinga PreMarket Prep on Friday.
 He was quoting Tom Siebel, CEO of C3.ai AI, an enterprise AI application development platform, and a company that Feinseth likes and invests in.
 “Every company is going to have to, in some way, deploy AI in tracking customer behavior, optimizing supply chains, and increase business efficiency and employee efficiency,” Feinseth added.
 “This is going to be the next goldrush — like automation and electronics was in the 1970s, home computing in the 1980s and the internet in 1990s and early 2000s.”

 Among the stocks Feinseth holds are what he calls the “hyperscalers” — those companies capable of easily adapting to meeting vast rises in demand, such as the Mag7 names like Amazon.com Inc AMZN, Alphabet Inc GOOGL and Microsoft Corp MSFT.
 At the lower-cap end of the market, he likes recently listed companies such as MongoDB MDB a database software developer that came to market in late 2017, Monday.Com MNDY, a project management software platform that debuted in June 2021, and C3.ai, whose IPO was in December 2021.
 But what of the dangers of AI — the existential threat to job security? Feinseth holds Adobe Inc ADBE shares, but doesn’t believe a graphic designer is going to lose his or her job to AI.
 “A graphic designer is going to lose his or her job to a graphic designer using AI to be more efficient and more creative,” he said.
 Feinseth added: “AI is going to increase operating efficiency, increase creativity, productivity and job satisfaction. Yes, there is one caveat – that we’ve all seen Terminator – so we know what could happen. But overall, the trend of increased AI adoption is going to continue.”
 Feinseth also holds shares in Intel Corp INTC, where he identifies long-term growth potential, especially due to the company’s significant $20 billion investment in new foundries, despite its 2023 gains.
 “This is important, especially as all the other companies in the world would like to move away from China and come back to the U.S.,” he said.
 Feinseth added that “we’ve seen many chip manufacturers and users like Apple Inc AAPL and even Nvidia Corp NVDA who’ve said that they’re interested in Intel Foundry Services.”

 Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is 🔒. Keep in mind that it is a Friday and short squeezes tend to occur on Fridays. This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades.
 It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.
 Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.
 You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative.The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.
 It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.
 Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.
 Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

36514210,Surbhi Jain,2024-01-05T17:49:52Z,2024-01-05T17:49:53Z,Nvidia Is Analyst's Top Sector Pick With Potential $100B FCF For Growth Initiatives Such As AI,How Nvidia is positioned for growth.,benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/01/36514210/nvidia-is-analysts-top-sector-pick-with-potential-100b-fcf-for-growth-initiatives-s,['NVDA'],2024-01-05 17:49:53+00:00,NVDA,Nvidia Is Analyst's Top Sector Pick With Potential $100B FCF For Growth Initiatives Such As AI - NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) - Benzinga,"Nvidia Corp.’s NVDA strategic trajectory, fueled by robust free cash flow (FCF) and an evolving approach to recurring revenue, positioned it for substantial growth and market revaluation in the foreseeable future. The stock is a top performer amid the “Magnificient 7,” returning 245% in 2023.The Nvidia Analyst: BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya maintained a Buy rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $700.
 The Nvidia Thesis: Per Arya, Nvidia emerged as a compelling investment opportunity amidst its promising prospects for the coming years. Arya forecasted $100 billion in FCF anticipated to materialize over CY24/CY25E. Nvidia stands poised to utilize this significant FCF generation to drive innovative growth initiatives.
 The key lies in shifting towards a more recurring revenue-oriented profile. While Nvidia leads in AI, its reliance on hardware-centric operations affects its valuation. The pursuit of acquisitions or partnerships to strengthen recurring revenue sources remains pivotal. The past bid for Arm Holdings exemplified Nvidia’s intent for software/IP assets.
 Nvidia’s Mellanox acquisition success, quintupling annualized revenue towards $10 billion, showcased its prowess in strategic investments. Expanding into storage to complement its compute and networking strengths could be a strategic move toward a comprehensive AI systems vendor role. 
 While Nvidia may not venture into becoming a specialized AI cloud service provider due to the hyper-competitive landscape, it remains invested in alternative GPU-focused CSP to broaden its reach.
 Currently generating only a modest percentage of revenue from software/subscriptions, strategic additions to its AI enterprise suite through M&A or enhanced partnerships could significantly augment recurring revenue in 2024.
 Anticipated catalysts, such as the CES and GTC tradeshows, hold the potential to catalyze stock movement, potentially breaking Nvidia out of its recent trading range. 
 Despite being among the largest U.S. stocks, Nvidia trades at a discount on various metrics compared to its peers, presenting an enticing investment opportunity.
 NVDA Price Action: Nvidia stock was up 2.25%  at $490.80 on Friday at the time of publication.

 This decision aims to prevent competition within its product line, particularly against the Radeon RX 6750 GRE, which is exclusive to the Chinese market. The Radeon RX 6750 GRE, known for its cost-effectiveness and high performance, is AMD's primary offering in China, Wccftech cites Benchlife. 
 Consequently, introducing the Radeon RX 7600 XT, which may only offer marginal upgrades over the RX 7600 but with double the VRAM, could lead to consumer confusion.
 The Radeon RX 7600 XT will likely feature 16 GB of GDDR6 VRAM, as a Gigabyte listing indicates, a potential price point of around $300, similar to the Radeon RX 6750 GRE pricing.

 The delay or likely non-release of the Radeon RX 7600 XT in China is likely a strategic move by AMD to maintain the popularity of the Radeon RX 6750 GRE, especially considering its performance advantages and competitive pricing compared to Nvidia Corp's NVDA RTX 4060 series and even AMD's own RX 7600.
 Recent releases like Sapphire's new ""Black Diamond"" variant of the Radeon RX 6750 GRE, which boasts up to 50% faster performance than the RTX 4060 in some games, further justify AMD's cautious approach to launching new GPUs in the Chinese market. 
 AMD focuses on preventing internal competition and ensuring that its consumers are not distracted by new releases that might not offer substantial improvements over existing models.
 Recently, AMD showcased new Versal AI Edge XA SoCs and Ryzen V2000A processors for automotive innovation at CES 2024.
 The U.S. intensified its semiconductor technology embargo on China in 2023 by including AI technology.

In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, META, and NVDA.
 Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.
 We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:
 The SPY SPY is hovering around 466.23. Bulls are aiming for an initial rise to 466.80, with hopes of continued strength pushing the price further to 467.51. If this level holds during trading, a further push to 468.16 is anticipated, with a high target for the day at 469.17.
 In contrast, if 466.23 does not hold as support, a bearish scenario unfolds with the price potentially falling to test 465.35. Further bearish momentum might bring the price down to 464.92, and in a strong sell-off, a further drop to a lower target of 464.16 is possible.
 The Q's QQQ are positioned around 395.04. Bulls are keen on maintaining prices above this level, with an eye on 396.81 as the next target. If the momentum remains robust, the price could ascend to 398.57 and potentially test 399.67. The day's bullish ambition is to reach 400.95.
 On the other hand, if 395.04 is breached downwards, bears might drive the price towards 393.96. Persistent weakness could lead to further declines to 392.77, with an extended bearish view aiming for a descent to the day's lower target of 390.09.
 Apple's AAPL trading level is around 180.10. Bulls are looking to hold this as support, with aspirations to rally higher to 180.60. If bullish sentiment continues, the price might climb to 181.25, with a high target for the day at 182.27.
 Conversely, if 180.10 is not maintained as support, bears may initiate a downward move to 179.36. Continued selling pressure might lead to further declines to 178.61 and, if the bearish momentum is strong, a descent to the day's bear target of 177.20.
 Microsoft MSFT is currently at about 366.98. Bullish traders are aiming to keep the price above this level, seeking a rally to 368.79 and eventually a push to a higher target of 370.10, with a day's high target at 372.03.
 Should 366.98 fail to hold, the bears might look to bring the price down to 365.35. If the price continues to fall, the next target is 363.81, with a bearish perspective pushing further down to a low target of 359.64 for the day.
  Tesla TSLA is trading near 235.74. Bulls are hoping to drive the price upwards to 238.50, with sustained buying potentially rallying the price to 239.92 and an optimistic high of 242.49, with the ultimate bull target for the day at 243.98.
 If 235.74 cannot be maintained as a strong support, the bearish outlook targets a drop to 233.49. If selling intensifies, the price might decrease further to 230.65, with a strong sell-off potentially pushing down to a bearish target of 228.45.
 Alphabet GOOGL is auctioning around 135.66. Bulls aim to lift the price to 136.29 and beyond, with a hopeful climb to 136.94 and a high target of 137.79.
 Should 135.66 not hold as a base, bears might force the price down to 134.96. Further selling could lead to a dip to 133.78, with a pessimistic view bringing it down to a lower target of 132.84.
 Meta META is near 345.04. Bulls are eyeing levels above 347.67, looking to push the auction higher towards 350.18 and an optimistic high of 353.60.
 On the contrary, if 345.04 fails as support, bears might target a decrease to 342.89. With continued selling, the price could fall further to 341.85, and in a bearish scenario, descend to a low day target of 340.66.
 NVIDIA NVDA is around 478.67. Bulls are looking to propel the price to 481.27 and further to 483.43, with a strong buying day targeting 485.93.
 Alternatively, if 478.67 doesn't hold, the bears aim to lower the price to 476.94. With sustained selling, a drop to 473.81 could be in sight, and in a heavier sell-off, the price might descend to 467.34 as the bearish target for the day.
 Final Word:  Today's trading will be heavily influenced by the release of extensive employment data, primarily the Non-Farm Payrolls report for December, unveiled during the premarket hours. This data is expected to shape market sentiment for not only today's regular trading hours but also the upcoming weeks leading to the January FOMC meeting. Traders are advised to exercise discipline as the volatility during today's session might be the peak for the week. Keep your head on a swivel, good luck, and have a great Friday!

 Data published on Friday by S3 Partners showed that short sellers in the U.S. and Canada were down $194.9 billion in 2023 — down 20.4% on an average short interest of $958 billion.
 These mark-to-market losses of 2023 offset two thirds of the $299.1 billion gain seen in 2022, with the biggest losses coming from the technology and consumer discretionary sectors.
 The biggest IT-based exchange traded fund by value of assets is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT and it gained 44.7% during 2023. Similarly, the biggest consumer discretionary ETF, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY was up 33.4% in 2023.
 It probably doesn’t need mentioning which were the least profitable short trades — let’s just run through the top three names:
 After the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks followed a host of Nvidia’s rival semiconductor makers. Indeed, the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, an exchange traded fund that tracks the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, was up 65% in 2023.
 Cryptocurrency shorting wasn’t very profitable either, and also among the biggest equity short losses was Coinbase Global Inc COIN, the crypto exchange, which lost short sellers $4.9 billion as the stock soared 341% higher in 2023.
 There were a few high-profile bankruptcies in 2023 which allowed short sellers some easy pickings from low-hanging fruit.
 The collapse of First Republic Bank — the second such banking failure during last year’s regional bank crisis — provided shorts with the biggest opportunity.
 From average short interest of $194.3 million, the total net profits reaped from the rapid share price decline and eventual demise of First Republic were $1.63 billion.
 The third-biggest total net gain was $1.06 billion from average short interest of $218.2 million, on short bets during the demise of Silicon Valley Bank, the first regional bank to collapse back in March.
 In second and fourth places came a pair of pharmaceuticals companies. Moderna MRNA in second place with total net profits of $1.2 billion and Pfizer PFE in fourth with $990.4 million as both companies reported dwindling sales and failures to cash in on the weigh-loss drug phenomenon that swept players such as Eli Lilly LLY rapidly higher in 2023.

TechInsights' teardown for Bloomberg News revealed a 5-nanometer chip made by TSMC in 2020, which contradicts speculations about Huawei's Chinese partner, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), achieving an advanced fabrication technique.
 According to Bloomberg, in August, Huawei released a smartphone with a 7nm processor made by SMIC, which was only slightly behind the current technology despite U.S. trade sanctions. 
 This development was initially perceived as a significant achievement for Chinese technology, sparking debates about the effectiveness of the sanctions, Bloomberg reports.

 TechInsights found that the L540's Kirin 9006C processor was fabricated using TSMC's 5nm method and assembled around the third quarter of 2020. 
 Industry experts had previously thought SMIC developed this capability, which would have been a considerable advancement for the Chinese chipmaker. 
 Previous reports indicated Chinese chip designers, including Tencent Holdings Ltd TCEHY, promoting their AI chips as options to Nvidia Corp's NVDA products as the U.S. sanctions on China intensified. Nvidia dominates up to 90% of China's $7 billion AI chip market. 
 Huawei's recent technological advancements, such as the Mate 60 smartphone, have strengthened its position as a leader in China's efforts to develop domestic technology, challenging Western dependence. Huawei's success with the Mate 60 helped it reach the $100 billion revenue mark, competing with Apple Inc's AAPL iPhone.
 Huawei's procurement of a three-year-old TSMC processor indicates its efforts to stockpile vital semiconductors amid U.S. restrictions. 
 Since being added to Washington's Entity List in 2019, Huawei has invested heavily in chip research and built a domestic supply chain, sometimes with government support.
 Huawei's L540 laptop is part of its effort to enter the mobile and computing device market, aligning with Beijing's push to replace foreign technology in sensitive areas. 
 The laptop is marketed for its security features, catering to China's stringent data security requirements in government sectors.
 Price Action: TSM shares traded lower by 0.31% at $98.82 premarket on the last check Friday.

 In ""How Abercrombie & Fitch Stock Went From Rags to Riches in 2023,"" Sabrina Escobar writes that Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF surprisingly spiked last year by revamping its image and sales, but the company's future growth in a fashion industry that is unpredictable remains unclear this year. 
 In ""Apple’s Losing Streak Hits 4 Days, Amid Report of Antitrust Investigation,"" Callum Keown and Eric J.

 In ""Shipping Stock Maersk Has Soared Amid Red Sea Attacks.

Moeller Maersk AMKBY, Hapag Llyod ADR HPGLY and more, with extended disruptions potentially leading to sustained higher premiums for transportation. 
 In ""Nvidia Can Make $100 Billion in Extra Cash Over the Next 2 Years, Says Analyst,"" Tae Kim writes that BofA Global Research expects Nvidia Corp. NVDA to make major profit from AI chip sales, projecting $100 billion in free cash flow over the following two years, which could lead to investments in recurring revenue and stock buybacks.
 In ""Think IBM Stock Is an AI Play? Analysts Say Don’t Get Carried Away Just Yet,"" Adam Clark says that while IBM IBM is aiming to be a leader in AI this year, it faces skepticism as analysts highlight the company's uphill battle in convincing the market.

These meetings, part of a larger series involving tech giants like Broadcom and Nvidia, were centered around crucial topics in European digital regulation, especially the implications of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and broader competition policies. In her discussions with Apple&#39;s Tim Cook, Vestager addressed the necessity for Apple to allow apps to be distributed beyond its proprietary AppStore, delving into ongoing competition issues including those related to Apple Music. Her meeting with Alphabet and Google&#39;s Sundar Pichai focused on the design of choice screens, the company&#39;s self-preferencing practices in relation to the DMA, and the Google adtech antitrust case. These interactions underline the EU&#39;s commitment to regulating major tech companies, defining their roles and responsibilities as &#34;gatekeepers&#34; under the DMA. This includes making their messaging apps interoperable and giving users more control over app installations. The specifics of Vestager&#39;s discussion with Qualcomm&#39;s Cristiano Amon were not detailed, but she emphasized the broader economic and security significance of chip technology in the EU. These high-level meetings are critical in shaping the operations of tech companies within the EU, ensuring they align with the region&#39;s digital strategy and competition laws.",benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/government/24/01/36609298/eu-cracks-down-on-tech-giants-apple-alphabet-and-qualcomm-in-regulatory-spotlight,"['AAPL', 'ADBE', 'AMZN', 'AVGO', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'IRBT', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'QCOM']",2024-01-12 12:59:57+00:00,NVDA,,

AAPL.
 What Happened: Gerber took to X on Thursday, expressing skepticism over the DOJ’s success in their recent cases and implying that the lawsuit against Apple was primarily about money.
 He also praised Apple Vision Pro, the latest major hardware launch from Cupertino. He described it as Apple's ""most important hardware since the iPhone.""

 ""Has the DOJ ever won any of these cases? It's just about money… Apple just launched their most important hardware since the iPhone… the DOJ is a 16 seed against the 1.""
 Has the DOJ ever won any of these cases? It's just about money… Apple just launched their most important hardware since the iPhone… the DOJ is a 16 seed against the 1.  #VisionPro for the championship! $aapl
 Apple has been sued by the DOJ on allegations of monopolist business practices. The lawsuit points at Apple's policies across various aspects of its iPhone and services business like the App Store, iMessage and accessories like the Apple Watch.
 Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.
 Why It Matters: While Apple has called the antitrust lawsuit ""dangerous,"" DOJ blamed the company for the failures of Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., and HTC, among others in the U.S. smartphone market.
 Apple Vision Pro, which has seen some mixed reviews since launch, recently got a boost thanks to Nvidia Corp.'s NVDA partnership with the Tim Cook-led company.
 Apple and Nvidia will leverage the latter's Omniverse technology to stream advanced 3D experiences to the Vision Pro headset.
 Price Action: On Friday, Apple’s shares were up 0.21% in premarket trading after closing at $171.37 on the previous day, according to Benzinga Pro.

Kicking off the year with significant momentum, Nvidia's stock experienced a 96% bull rally that continued through to March, nearly reaching the $1000 milestone.
 However, the climb halted at $974, facing resistance that put a halt to its upward move, leading to a 13% dip in value. Currently, Nvidia is in a consolidation phase, with its stock price oscillating between $756 and $974.
 The market looks optimistic, but the company is walking a fine line. If it drops below $756, it might indicate a downturn, but breaking past $974 could signal further growth.
 With May 22 on the horizon, focus is on Nvidia once again and its anticipated first-quarter earnings report. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $5.18 per share, a figure that puts pressure on Nvidia to continue its positive earnings streak from the last four quarters.
 A positive earnings report could push the stock to surpass its previous highs. Currently, Nvidia finds itself in a slight downturn, down 2%, while still in consolidation.
 
 For investors, the message is clear. Patience and vigilance in monitoring key support and resistance levels are crucial. This upcoming earnings report holds the potential to kickstart Nvidia's next bullish phase.
 After the closing bell on Tuesday, April 30, the stock closed at $864.02, trading down by 1.50%.

 Bryson noted that Supermicro guided revenues for the year meaningfully higher, suggesting sales momentum is only accelerating into the fiscal fourth quarter. At the same time, the midpoint of management’s guidance implicitly suggests gross margin deterioration of ~200 bps and an operating margin decline of ~100 bps. 
 The expected dip in margins, in turn, necessarily caters to concerns about how competition might weigh on SMCI’s ability to translate AI-related server growth into profit, both in the current quarter and moving forward, the analyst said. The result mirrors the dichotomy that has kept him on the sidelines regarding SMCI over the past 12 months. 
 SMCI has successfully changed its narrative from that of a scrappy underdog supplying customers with cheaper and more customized solutions to the leading OEM of AI servers.
 SMCI sales momentum is unlikely to diminish over the next few quarters as Nvidia Corp’s NVDA offerings transition to H200 and Blackwell. However, the analyst continues to see the server market as competitive.
 Bryson projected fourth-quarter revenue of $5.30 billion (prior $4.81 billion) and EPS of $8.09 (prior $7.04).
 BofA Securities analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya reiterated a Buy rating on SMCI with a price target of $1,090.
 Super Micro reported fiscal third-quarter revenue slightly below consensus. The analyst noted that the small topline miss was driven by a lack of component availability late in the quarter. 
 Bhattacharya’s bullish thesis remains intact, as the company is expected to significantly exceed consensus forecasts for the June quarter. SMCI is on course to achieve production of over 2,000 direct-to-chip (DTC) liquid-cooled racks monthly by quarter’s end, and the introduction of GB200 solutions in fiscal 2025 is anticipated to increase the average selling price per system.
 SMCI is also poised to expand its market by serving additional chip vendors beyond Nvidia. The company continues to see strong demand from Tier-2 CSPs and enterprises and is positioned to capitalize on upcoming sovereign AI demand.
 Super Micro remains a pure-play AI server vendor, and Bhattacharya expects continued positive estimate revisions in the long term.
 Bhattacharya projected fourth-quarter revenue of $5.30 billion and EPS of $8.10.
 Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng reiterated a Neutral rating on SMCI with a price target of $800, down from the prior $937.
 Ng’s price target cut reflects increasing uncertainty around SMCI’s AI server market share.
 SMCI’s fiscal third-quarter results were largely as expected, with revenue of $3.85 billion (v. consensus of $3.96 billion), gross profit of $601 million (v. consensus of $593 million), and increased fiscal 2024 revenue guidance to $14.7 billion—$15.1 billion, which implies $5.1 billion—$5.5 billion for the fiscal fourth-quarter, Ng noted. 
 While the potential margin dilutive impact from AI server sales and competition is a concern, SMCI reiterated its long-term 14% – 17% gross margin target. Ng noted that elevated product costs from liquid cooling should normalize over time. Separately, SMCI said it could need additional capital to support growth.
 Encouragingly, demand appears strong, as evidenced by SMCI achieving a record backlog, Ng added.
 Ng projected fourth-quarter revenue of $5.27 billion and EPS of $8.08.
 JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee reiterated an Overweight rating on SMCI with a price target of $1,150.
 Chatterjee identified two main concerns reflected in the company’s share price. Firstly, there are worries about gross margins. The company predicts these will be within the long-term range of 14%-17% for the fiscal fourth quarter. 
 However, the guidance suggests that margins will be at the lower end of this range, which follows a gross margin of 15.6% in the fiscal third quarter. This raises concerns about the company’s willingness to sacrifice margins to pursue revenue growth.
 Secondly, there’s the issue of potential capital raises. While the company has stated it has sufficient capital to manage growth of 20%-30%, achieving higher growth rates as projected will require additional capital. This is necessary to meet the inventory requirements for reliably servicing customers.
 With demand continuing strong, investors are now grappling with the challenge of how further capital raises might dilute earnings.
 Chatterjee projected fourth-quarter revenue of $5.30 billion and EPS of $8.11.
 Super Micro Computer stock gained 591% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Invesco S&P MidCap Momentum ETF XMMO and IShares U.S. Digital Infrastructure And Real Estate ETF IDGT.
 Price Action: SMCI shares were down 11.8% at $757.01 at last check Wednesday.

 Despite recent setbacks, including declining revenue and earnings, investors are intrigued by Intel’s potential for a turnaround and long-term growth.
 One Redditor highlighted Intel’s favorable market cap compared to key competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD, Nvidia Corp NVDA, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd TSM, and Samsung.

 With a market cap of approximately $130 billion, Intel is seen as undervalued, especially when considering its potential upside. If Intel can execute its plans under CEO Pat Gelsinger and become the second-largest chip manufacturer behind TSMC, there could be significant upside for investors.
 The current price presents a reasonable expectation of preserving investment with a solid chance of substantial returns if Intel’s plans materialize.
 “In my opinion, this is a good play. It’s a Monish Pabrai “High uncertainty, low risk” type play.”
 “Sum of parts valuation for INTC is 50+ People forget the foundry business and focus only on chip design.”
 Another key point of discussion was Intel’s increased focus on research and development (R&D). 
 Intel’s role in developing technologies used by competitors like TSMC and AMD is noteworthy. The company has the first EUV scanner and is working on processes that could take chip technology below 1nm. 
 This indicates Intel has the potential to lead the industry in the coming years. Despite past missteps, Intel is investing heavily in cutting-edge technologies like High NA EUV and backside power delivery. These innovations could position Intel as a leader in the chip industry once again.
 “Intel will be the first to rollout High NA EUV. Theyre going to be the first to do backside power delivery.”
 “Intel has the first EUV scanner and are developing the processes that will take us sub 1nm. They are the easiest play if you want to get rich over the next 15 years.”
 While some investors remain cautious, citing Intel’s history of failed turnarounds, others see the current price as a buying opportunity. Intel’s fundamentals and turnaround plan remain unchanged, suggesting that the stock’s current low valuation may be unwarranted.
 Intel’s stock is a compelling opportunity for investors seeking long-term growth. While risks remain, including the company’s track record and the broader market environment, many Reddit investors see Intel as a high-potential, low-risk investment.

 The New Jersey-based company expects to use the new funding to support the growth across all areas of its business, and expansion into new geographic regions.
 The substantial funding values CoreWeave at $19 billion, signaling strong demand for AI computation, reported The Wall Street Journal.

 The report noted that the company, specializing in AI-tailored cloud-computing, distinguishes itself from tech giants like Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Amazon.com Inc AMZN, focusing solely on AI-related services.
 “CoreWeave continues to push forward as a provider of critical infrastructure in the development of AI, and the high caliber of investors who continue putting their trust in us validates the enormous opportunity we have to define the next generation of cloud computing,” said Mike Intrator, co-founder and CEO of CoreWeave.
 In December 2023, CoreWeave closed a secondary investment of $642 million, following a $420 million primary led by Magnetar in April 2023.
 In August 2023, CoreWeave secured a $2.3 billion debt financing facility. Also, CoreWeave increased its data center presence in the last year from three to 14 and quadrupled its employee headcount.

 The forthcoming Federal Open Market Committee statement is anticipated to maintain interest rates where they are and possibly unveil a reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet runoff from $60 billion to $30 billion monthly. Fed Chair Jerome Powell‘s press conference is at 2:30 p.m. ET.
 The S&P 500 inched 0.2% lower, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 underperformed, down 0.6%. Blue chips managed to avoid losses and showcased a 0.3% rise. 
 Aside from Fed policy, earnings remain a key driver of market sentiment, particularly as chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD offered less optimistic second-quarter guidance than expected. This news led to a nearly 10% drop in its share price. In sympathy, the broader industry saw a decline, with heavyweight Nvidia Corp. NVDA also experiencing a more than 5% decrease in its shares.
 Data-wise, the ADP National Employment Report revealed a stronger-than-expected private jobs addition in April, ahead of the highly awaited official jobs report on Friday. The ISM Manufacturing Index surprisingly fell back into contraction territory, missing expectations.

 Here is how Wall Street analysts are reacting to the results and updated guidance.
 The AMD Analysts: Cantor Fitzgerlad analyst C.J. Muse has an Overweight rating and lowered the price target from $190 to $170.
 Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh has a Buy rating and lowered the price target from $235 to $215.
 Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar has an Overweight rating and lowered the price target from $195 to $175.
 Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari has a Buy rating and lowered the price target from $180 to $175.
 KeyBanc analyst John Vinh has an Overweight rating and lowered the price target from $270 to $230.
 Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson has an Outperform rating and price target of $200.
 Truist analyst William Stein has a Hold rating and lowered the price target from $174 to $162.
 Roth MKM analyst Suji Desilva has a Buy rating and lowered the price target from $190 to $180.
 Cantor Fitzgerald On AMD: AMD’s share momentum could be hit by capped earnings leverage, Muse said after the first quarter report.
 ""The MI300 ramp is truly impressive, but supply constraints are limiting a vision for even greater upside where many investors have been discussing much higher #s up until recently,"" the analyst said. 
 Muse also cautioned on gaming segment weakness that could offset growth in other areas.
 ""Add it all up, and it now appears CY24/25 revenues are tracking to $25.5B/$30.5B – for solid growth of 13%/20%, but below consensus coming in at $25.8B/$32.4B.""
 The analyst said the ""2025 and beyond story remains intact"" with artificial intelligence a key opportunity for AMD — the No. 2 merchant AI supplier behind NVIDIA Corporation NVDA.
 Mizuho On AMD: The outlook for AMD’s artificial intelligence segment is below expectations, said analyst Rakesh.
 ""AMD guided 2024 AI GPU revenue to >$4B, slightly below optimistic Street expectations of $6-$10B, but also noting ‘not supply limited and 2H-weighted,"" the analyst said. 
 The analyst said there is a concern that aggressive pricing from Nvidia and good lead times could hurt AMD.
 ""Overall, we believe AI demand remains strong and AMD provides a strong second-source supplier (with key customers GOOGL, META, ORCL, Corewave, TSLA).""
 Piper Sandler On AMD: AMD’s gaming and embedded segments struggled in the first quarter and were key headwinds, Kumar said.
 ""That said, the parts of the business that matter in our view, namely MI300 and the server business, did exceedingly well and continue to get better,"" the analyst said. 
 MI300 demand is set to exceed supply, with supply ramping up in each quarter of 2024, Kumar said. 
 ""We feel AMD continues to deliver on its core businesses that investors care about with headwinds from non-core pieces.""
 Goldman Sachs On AMD: The company's data center GPU growth and server CPU share gains were highlights in the first quarter, according to Hari.
 ""While the positive revision to AMD's 2024 Data Center GPU revenue outlook to $4.0 billion may have underwhelmed the most bullish of investor expectations, we continue to believe that the company is making the appropriate investments and has the long-term product roadmap in place to benefit from growth in AI infrastructure spending,"" the analyst said. 
 The analyst said CPU market share gains could continue in the second half of 2024 and in 2025.
 AMD highlighted increased engagements with existing customers and onboarding new customers for its data center GPU ramp, Hari said. 
 AMD’s competition with Nvidia in the data center GPU market remains a concern, the analyst said. 
 ""We look forward to learning more from AMD over the coming months and quarters about its long-term product roadmap and how it intends to differentiate vis-à-vis not only Nvidia but also custom compute solutions introduced by many of the cloud hyperscalers.""
 KeyBanc On AMD: AMD’s first-quarter results were solid, according to Vinh, with the second-quarter guidance coming in mixed. 
 ""We are firm believers in AMD's revitalized product roadmap strategy, and product traction is compelling. However, expectations for share gains and growth are high,"" the analyst said. 
 The analyst is concerned there is risk to the stock, with its valuation sitting above peers and any downside in expectations weighing significantly on the stock.
 Wedbush On AMD: The AI guidance from AMD implies quadruple digit year-over-year growth in GPU sales, Bryson said, adding the market reaction implies that ""over 1,000% growth isn't enough.
 ""Despite AMD again lifting the bar for accelerator sales, with management now expecting to book north of $4B in 2024, the stock still fell in after-hours trading,"" the analyst said. 
 Investors could be missing the forest for the trees, similar to AMD's last quarterly earnings report and the resulting stock sell-off, Bryson said. 
 ""The raised guide should have been viewed as AMD solidifying its position as the primary alternative to NVDA in the AI accelerator market.""
 Truist On AMD: The $4-billion guidance for data center GPU is not what bulls hoped for or what bears feared, Stein said.
 The analyst said the guidance will draw a mixed reaction from investors. Stein has concerns around AMD's position versus Nvidia and new CPU competitors.
 Roth MKM On AMD: The semiconductor company saw AI growth offset non-AI headwinds, Desilva said.
 ""We are encouraged that the company raised its CY24 AI GPU revenue expectation and is also seeing a tailwind with client AI PC, offsetting persistent inventory impact in other segments,"" the analyst said. 
 The analyst said MI300 GPU revenues have passed the $1-billion revenue mark in only two quarters.
 ""We are confident that the current ramp is diversified across multiple hyperscale and emerging enterprise customer opportunities versus CY23 dependence on a large HPC program ramp.""
 AMD Price Action: AMD shares are down 9.14% to $143.90 on Wednesday versus a 52-week trading range of $81.02 to $227.30. Shares of AMD are up over 60% in the last year.

 Currently, Alibaba rents server space from Vietnamese state-owned telecommunications companies Viettel and VNPT. 
 The arrangement follows Vietnam’s contentious 2022 law mandating that companies store data within the country—a regulation that sparked resistance from major tech firms like Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL Google and Amazon.Com Inc AMZN, the Nikkei Asia reports.
 Dang Minh Tam, Alibaba Cloud’s solution architect lead, noted that the company uses colocation services from these state companies to store client data locally. It also maintains backups across its server farms in regions including Taiwan and Singapore. 
 The move is part of Alibaba’s strategy to ensure better security and control over its data and potentially reduce costs and liability issues associated with multi-company data management. 
 Companies including Nvidia Corp NVDA, Apple Inc AAPL, and Lam Research Corp LRCX have reached out to Vietnam to diversify their supply chain base amid heightening geopolitical tensions between the US and China.
 Lam Research weighed the supply chain shift to Vietnam, with the Vietnamese government canvassing the former to commit $1 billion to local production efforts.
  Apple suppliers in Vietnam increased by 40% to 35 in 2023.
 Meanwhile, Nvidia tapped Vietnamese tech firms for AI development.
 Alibaba stock lost over 11% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Invesco Golden Dragon China ETF PGJ and Tidal Trust II CoreValues Alpha Greater China Growth ETF CGRO.

 Please click here for an enlarged chart of Super Micro Computer Inc SMCI.
 Note the following:
 SMCI has become a favorite of the momo crowd. The momo crowd incorrectly thinks SMCI has the same potential as Nvidia (NVDA). Investors need to keep in mind the following:
 SMCI moves a lot more than NVDA. SMCI is so volatile because of the small float.
 SMCI is an assembler of servers for artificial intelligence. It uses components from NVDA, Micron (MU), and Marvell (MRVL).
 NVDA has a large moat to protect it that includes IP for its GPUs. SMCI has no moat and the barrier to entry for competitors is low.
 SMCI sales are to hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG). The reason SMCI sales are booming is that they have availability of NVDA chips. As chips become more available to competitors, SMCI will not be able to sustain its sales growth rate.
 The momo crowd is buying SMCI due to lack of knowledge.  However, there are many investors who understand and have the knowledge of SMCI's business. Many such investors are short selling SMCI.  For the time being, short sellers are being overwhelmed by the YOLO crowd.
 Taking all of the above into consideration with the quantitative analysis screen of the ZYX Change Method, in an optimistic case, the fair value of SMCI stock is $442 - $486.
 In the early trade, money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc Class C GOOG, and Microsoft Corp MSFT.
 In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Meta Platforms Inc META.
 In the early trade, money flows are negative in Apple Inc AAPL, NVIDIA Corp NVDA, and Tesla Inc TSLA.
 In the early trade, money flows are negative in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ.
 The momo crowd is buying stocks in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade.
 The momo crowd is buying gold in the early trade.  Smart money is inactive in the early trade.
 For longer-term, please see gold and silver ratings.
 The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust GLD. The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust SLV. 
 The momo crowd is selling oil in the early trade.  Smart money is inactive in the early trade.
 For longer-term, please see oil ratings.
 The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF USO.
 Bitcoin BTC/USD has fallen below $60,000 on momo crowd selling.  Recent momo crowd bitcoin buyers who fell prey to whales’ propaganda of buying on bitcoin halving and bought bitcoin above $70,000 are panicking and selling. Of course, if you listened to the podcast on bitcoin halving, you knew in advance that this was a high probability outcome.
 It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.
 Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.
 You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.
 It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.  When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.  High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.
 Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.
 Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.
 Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.
 We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:
 Currently, the SPY SPY is trading around the 500.17 mark. Bulls are looking for an upward movement to 500.91 initially. If this level is surpassed with strong momentum, the next target is 503.95, which we hope will act as a robust support level. Holding above 503.95 could pave the way for a move towards 506.71, and our optimistic target for the bulls today is 508.34.
 On the downside, if the SPY fails to maintain 500.17 as support, we anticipate a bearish descent towards 498.93. A confirmed break below this point could lead the price down to 496.93. Should selling pressure intensify, we expect further decline to 494.27, with the lowest bear target set at 492.39 for the day.
 The QQQ index QQQ is positioning around 422.16. Bulls are aiming to sustain the price above 424.04, targeting 425.77 as a firm support level. If maintained, the buying momentum might push the price towards 426.64, potentially testing 427.32. The highest bull target for today is set at 428.50.
 Conversely, if the QQQ cannot hold above 422.16, bears might take control, pushing the price down to 420.76. A breakdown from there could see a further dip to 419.19, and persistent selling might test 417.49. If this support gives way, the lowest bear target for the day is 416.23.
 Apple AAPL shares are trading near the 170.32 level. Bulls are eyeing 171.13 as a crucial support to hold, aiming for an upward trajectory towards 171.79 and potentially 172.45 if the upward momentum persists. The highest bull target for Apple today is 173.94.
 Should Apple fail to keep 170.32 as support, the downside target is set at 168.99. Increasing sell-off could push the price further down to 168.00 and then to 167.09. A break below this level could lead to a test of the day's lowest bear target at 166.27.
 Microsoft MSFT is being traded around 390.98. For bullish prospects, the aim is to maintain above 392.49, leading to a potential rally to 394.46. Holding this level could propel the stock towards 395.68, with a bull target of 400.30 for the day.
 If Microsoft cannot sustain 390.98 as support, the bearish scenario involves a descent to 387.60. A break below this level might lead to further downside tests at 385.42, pushing towards 382.69. The lowest bear target for today is 381.64.
 NVIDIA NVDA is hovering around 846.80. Bulls are looking to push the price to 852.61 and establish it as a solid support level. If successful, the next targets are 865.62 and 877.25, with a high bull target of 882.97 for the day.
 If NVIDIA cannot maintain 846.80 as support, bears might drive the price down to 842.42. A failure there could see a further drop to 837.58 and, if selling pressure continues, a test of 833.50. The day's lowest bear target is 827.98.
 Alphabet GOOGL is currently positioned at 163.79. Bulls are aiming to secure 165.41 as support and push the price to 167.04. If bullish momentum continues, the target moves up to 169.34.
 Should Alphabet's price fail to hold 163.79 as support, the bears are expected to push it down to 161.79. A break below this could bring 160.36 into play, with a further descent possibly leading to the lowest bear target of the day at 158.54.
 Meta META is trading around 426.00. Bulls are aiming to maintain strength above 429.01, pushing higher to 432.39 and potentially 436.87. The bullish momentum could lead to a high target of 441.35 for the day.
 On the downside, if Meta cannot hold 426.00 as support, the target shifts to 420.24. A breakdown there could lead to further drops to 417.87, and potentially down to the day's lowest bear target at 415.05.
 Tesla TSLA is trading near 179.79. Bulls are aiming to push the price up to 182.53 and, with continued buying, possibly to 184.10. A broader market rally could see Tesla reaching 186.10, with a high bull target of 189.22 for the day.
 If Tesla fails to hold 179.79 as support, bears might lead a decline to 176.34. Continued selling could push the price to 172.61, and if bearish momentum holds, down to the lowest bear target of 169.70 for the day.
 Final Word:  Today's trading session is stacked with pivotal economic data and events that could significantly impact market dynamics. The day kicks off with the ADP Non-Farm Employment Change at 8:15AM ET, which provides early insights into labor market conditions. Shortly thereafter, at 8:30AM ET, we will have the Quarterly Treasury Refunding Announcement, an event that could influence bond market movements. At 9:45AM ET, the Final S&P Global Manufacturing PMI will be released, offering key indicators of economic health in the manufacturing sector. At 10AM ET, attention shifts to the Construction Spending report for March and the JOLTS Job Openings for March, alongside the ISM numbers for April, all of which could sway investor sentiment. The climax of today's economic calendar is at 2PM ET with the FOMC's Interest Rate Decision, followed by Fed Chair Powell’s press conference at 2:30PM ET. Given the array of critical data and the potential for high volatility, traders are advised to maintain a heightened level of caution and strict discipline in their trading strategies. Best of luck navigating today's complex market environment!

However, the afternoon’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision and subsequent press conference by Chairman Jerome Powell could be the key catalyst that ultimately determines the session’s direction.
 Despite potential short-term headwinds, some analysts view the April market pullback as a necessary correction after a strong rally, paving the way for renewed momentum in the coming months.
 Cues From Previous Session:
 Inclement economic data weighed down on the market on Tuesday, as the major averages reversed course, snapping a two-session advance. The employment cost index – a measure of wage-induced inflation rose more than expected in the first quarter, Chicago region’s manufacturing activity sunk further into contraction territory and consumer confidence fell below a threshold that demarcates receding and improving sentiment, three separate reports showed.
 Bond yields spiked, exerting further downward pressure on stocks.
 The averages opened narrowly mixed and moved roughly sideways in early trading. The indices declined steadily through the remainder of the session, ending notably lower for the day. The sell-off was broad-based, with IT, energy, and consumer discretionary stocks serving as big drags.
 For the month, the indices fell 4.41%, 4.16%, 5.00% and 7.09%, respectively, with the S&P 500 snapping a five-month winning run.
 Insights From Analysts:
 Powell alone can help lift some of the overhang surrounding the rate outlook and this could be the need of the hour, according to an analyst. Charlie Ripley, Senior Investment Strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said, “Market sentiment continues to waver on inflation-related data sets,” said the analyst, adding that data showing a jump in employment costs left an “unsavory taste in the mouth of investors.” 
 “The continued realization that sticky service-related inflation metrics are taking a bite out of the Fed's rate-cutting plans has investors on edge for the time being and this is squarely being reflected in the sell-off of both bonds and equities,” Ripley said.
 He expects Powell to help shed some light on the current uncertainty surrounding the path of policy rates.  
 Carson Group’s Ryan Detrick, meanwhile, isn’t worried about the normally bullish April struggling this year. The S&P 500 Index has been higher for five months in a row heading into it and some type of break was warranted, he said.
 “In fact, we wouldn't be surprised if stocks consolidated for another month or so, working off some of the historic rebound off the late-October lows. We do not expect major weakness, but a break makes sense,” he added.
 Detrick raised the specter of a summer rally, and strength during these six months, given it is an election year and stocks have been strong so far this year.

 Stocks In Focus: 
 Commodities, Bonds, and Global Equity Markets:
 Crude oil futures fell for a third straight session, as the price pulled back toward the $80-a-barrel mark, and gold futures were little changed with a negative bias. An ounce of gold traded for around $2,300.
 The 10-year note yield edged up and was around the 4.69% mark.
 Bitcoin BTC/USD pulled back sharply toward the $57K mark.
 Most global equity markets remained closed for the Labor Day holiday. The open ones, including Japan, New Zealand, and Australia, settled lower ahead of the U.S. Fed decision.

AMD CEO Lisa Su highlighted the company’s AI hardware’s superior performance over NVIDIA Corp NVDA and its potential to cut customer costs during the first quarter earnings call this year.
 What Happened: Su claimed that AMD’s MI300X GPUs offer better inferencing performance and significant total cost of ownership (TCO) advantages compared to Nvidia’s H100 GPUs. 
 She also noted that the MI300X GPUs could deliver the same amount of compute with 45% fewer servers than the competition, potentially reducing initial capex by up to half and lowering annual opex by more than 40%.
 “Our partners are seeing very strong performance in their AI workloads. As we jointly optimize for their models, MI300X GPUs are delivering leadership, inferencing performance and substantial TCO advantages compared to H100,” Su said.

 She added, “For instance, several of our partners are seeing significant increases in tokens per second when running their flagship LLMs on MI300X compared to H100.”
 Why It Matters: AMD’s first quarter earnings call comes on the heels of a modest beat and lukewarm guidance, which caused a pullback in the stock. Despite this, Su’s remarks about the MI300X GPUs’ performance and cost advantages could help bolster investor confidence in the company’s AI hardware.
 Earlier in April, analyst predictions about the MI300 chip’s strong growth and success in the server market had already set a positive tone for AMD’s AI hardware. Su’s recent comments further reinforce the potential of AMD’s AI hardware in the market.
 Price Action: AMD stock traded lower in after-hours trading, with a decrease of 6.91% to $147.43 on Tuesday. Nonetheless, the stock has seen a 14.29% increase year-to-date, according to the data from Benzinga Pro.
