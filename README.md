### Introduction
FinSights aims to harness the power of generative AI and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to create memory retrieval modules that can autonomously assist in decision-making for investors. FinSights combines price action and news to analyze earnings reports and market sentiment from news articles. The projectâ€™s objective is to build an AI-powered agent that can enhance trading strategies by offering data-driven insights, thus helping investors achieve better risk-adjusted returns.
